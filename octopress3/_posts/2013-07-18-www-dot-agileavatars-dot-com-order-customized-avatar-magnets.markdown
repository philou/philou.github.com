As agile and lean methodologies are gaining some place inside the workplace, especially in large corporations, I heard and saw quite a few teams struggling with their whiteboard because of :

 * falling post-its
 * too few magnets
 * looking alike customized magnets

The best practice seemed to order magnetic paper, and loose half a day to create individual avatars, print them and stick them to small pieces of magnetic paper.

This is the main idea behind [AgileAvatars.com](http://www.agileavatars.com). The main feature would be :

 * create the avatars for your whole team
 * pass a group order, and receive the whole package directly at work

For the moment, I am just testing the idea, so please enter your email in [the contact form](http://www.agileavatars.com) to push the product. Tweet about it and it will be even better !

If it turns out people are interested, I'll start defining the MVP with the interested users :

 * How much should I charge to burn the magnets ?
 * Should it be a web or phone app ?
 * How to create the avatars ?
