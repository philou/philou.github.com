<p>The company I work for, <a href="https://murex.com/">Murex</a>, is currently going through a large transformation. This transformation involves training teams to new skills and practices. One such training is the lean concept of “Built-in quality at the source”.</p>

<p>Built-in quality at the source is first of all a set of practices (<a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Crafting</a>, <a href="/categories/#tdd">Test Driven Development</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior Driven Development</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</a>…). Unfortunately, the training was too theoretical. Attendees reported that it was painful and, in the end, useless.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 Stop of boring people out with theory of queues. Play the built-in quality serious game for learning why software best practices matter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had played the <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/dice-of-debt-game/">Dice of Debt game</a> with some other Murex agile coaches. They asked me if I knew of a serious game for learning Built-in quality at the source. I did not, and that’s why we decided we could build our own!</p>

<p>Before finishing this story, let’s first see why this subject is so important.</p>

<h2 id="why-built-in-quality-at-the-source-matters">Why built-in quality at the source matters</h2>

<p>When we postpone quality, we discover problems late and they come back messing up the value flow. It can create so much perturbation that nothing gets done without tremendous efforts. </p>

<p>Imagine you are working on user story X when a bug appears. This creates at least 3 problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ll receive useless stress</li>
  <li>You’ll lose some time switching from one task to another</li>
  <li>People who might be waiting for story X will have to find something else to do…</li>
</ol>

<p>Things get even worse at a larger scale. Suppose your team has been building a new feature for 6 months before it goes live and … users don’t like it! You might need to throw away everything and start with a new feature… Leaving a code architecture that is not adapted to what you now need.</p>

<p>This is not a sustainable pace.</p>

<p><img src="https://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2019-03-08-a-serious-game-for-learning-built-in-quality-at-the-source/built-in-quality-vicious-circle.jpeg" alt="A schema of the vicious circle triggered by the lack of built-in quality at the source. ... -&gt; No Built-in Quality -&gt; Issues discovered late -&gt; Firefighting &amp; Multitasking -&gt; Stress -&gt; Shortcuts -&gt; Neglect best practices -&gt; No Built-in Quality -&gt; ..." /></p>

<p>In summary, without built-in quality at the source, people get stressed, which makes them take shortcuts and neglect refactoring, which degrades the code quality, which makes building-in quality at the source even harder…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 Build-in quality at the source to enable a sustainable pace and continuous refactoring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said earlier, the first inspiration came from the Dice of Debt. It’s another serious game for learning the perils of technical debt. From the Dice of Debt, we kept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the dice</li>
  <li>simulating a software development team</li>
  <li>playing over a few iterations</li>
  <li>tracking what we were are building</li>
</ul>

<p>We wanted to show the value of a few built-in quality practices, on the flow. We naturally thought of a <a href="/categories/#kanban">Kanban board</a>.</p>

<p>I created just enough material and rules to test the game. We had a test session with volunteer agile coaches at Murex.</p>

<p>This first session was encouraging. The feedback was positive and we got plenty of ideas to improve the game. </p>

<p>For example, we decided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to simplify the Kanban flow</li>
  <li>to write the mechanics of the game on the material as much as possible</li>
  <li>to assign roles to players to start more quickly</li>
</ul>

<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://about.me/damienmenanteau">Damien Menanteau</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hghorayeb">Hicham Ghorayeb</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-soares-19812b13/?originalSubdomain=fr">Joseph Soares</a>, <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/juliejeru">Julie Jeru</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrussa">Matthieu Tournemire</a></p>

<h2 id="the-training-day">The training day</h2>

<p>Once we finalized the material, we were ready for our first real-life training.</p>

<p>They were about 40 people attending the training. We had 6 teams of about 7 people play the game at the same time.</p>

<figure class="">
  <img src="https://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2019-03-08-a-serious-game-for-learning-built-in-quality-at-the-source/1-team-small.jpeg" alt="A close-up photo of a team playing the serious game for learning built-in quality at the source" /><figcaption>

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>As part of a day-long training, we had agenda constraints for our game. We decided to use a faster “real-time” version, where all roles can play at the same time. Indeed, it is faster, but at the cost of lower learning. I definitely recommend to use the turn based version if you can.</p>

<p>Even with this small glitch, the feedback and engagement were great. For example, teams understood that continuous delivery is better than big batch deployment.</p>

<p>The coaches gave great feedback too. They said they would love to use this serious-game for teaching “Built-in Quality at the source”. That’s why I decided to <a href="https://philou.github.io/built-in-quality-game/">open source it</a>. </p>

<h2 id="try-it-yourself">Try it yourself!</h2>

<p>The game is only 1h15, it’s not too hard to find the time to play it. </p>

<p>If you are a team-member, try it with your team. Next time you do an end-of-sprint celebration, or when you have a bit of <a href="https://www.solutionsiq.com/resource/blog-post/the-importance-of-slack-in-achieving-speed-and-quality/">Slack Time</a>. You could also organize a team lunch and play the game at the same time.</p>

<p>If you are a coach, the game is a good substitute for a training. People are usually happy to play instead of attending a classroom training.</p>
