  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the third post in a <a href="/blog/categories/agile-transformations-fail-series/">series about making large organizations more agile</a>. I encourage you to <a href="/why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-1-the-situation/">start with the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s summarize the previous posts. Large scale &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; transformation programs usually fall short of their promise. One reason is that leaders forget to provide a safe context to learn.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-01-11-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-3-what-to-do/donkey-carrot-stick.jpg" alt="A kid trying to drive a donkey with a carrot and a stick" /></p>

<h2>What should we do ?</h2>

<p>First, we should take the time ! Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day. The road to an agile organization is a never ending path. We should also remember what we are after :</p>

<ul>
<li>Super fast adaptation to business changes through massive decentralization</li>
<li>Low process overhead thanks to people&rsquo;s buy-in</li>
<li>Continuous innovation in both products and organization, relying on everyone&rsquo;s creativity</li>
</ul>


<p>This is far more ambitious than a mere 5% productivity increase !</p>

<h2>Be patient for people to learn</h2>

<p>The goal is for people to be able to take bigger decisions on the spot. No one can learn this in a few hours. All over the company, people will have to improve their problem solving skills. They might also need to learn how to do root cause analysis. They&rsquo;ll need to take into account the point of views of other people in the organization. Some will need to beef up their communication skills as well. All will need to master new collaboration practices to stay up to date with what is going on.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 An organization cannot be agile if all decisions have to go up and down the management ladder.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot, and it takes time. The visible part of the iceberg, the collaboration practices, can be setup in a few weeks. But it won&rsquo;t yield much until the people are bold enough to take decisions by themselves.</p>

<p>First, I need to have a word about the workload in this section. If people are <a href="http://barryoreilly.com/2017/05/31/busy-to-death/">Busy to Death</a>, They won&rsquo;t have the time to learn. They won&rsquo;t even have the mood to think. Again, lasting productivity goes through sustainable pace. Slack time or a 20% policy are very good investments here !</p>

<p>Communication skills alone take months or years to improve. A communication training campaign can help to make the company ready to be more agile. In a previous team, new joiners used to attend a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">Non-Violent Communication</a> training. Being transparent a constructive is a foundation of an agile organization.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1515736081&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=five+dysfunctions+of+a+team"><img src="../imgs/2018-01-11-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-3-what-to-do/5-dysfunctions-of-a-team.jpg" alt="Pyramid of the 5 dysfunctions of a team book&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, root cause analysis and problem solving skills take practice to get around. Some organizations, used to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick">carrots and sticks</a>, have been avoiding this for years ! Good coaches can teach this to teams. People first need to learn that it&rsquo;s OK to look into problems and to experiment solutions though. That&rsquo;s where a safe environment helps.</p>

<h2>The Safe environment enhancer</h2>

<p>If people remain afraid to fail, they won&rsquo;t do enough experiments. As a result, they&rsquo;ll learn slower. They&rsquo;ll also keep delegating more decisions ! The organization won&rsquo;t become very agile. Sure, leaders will get small productivity and predictability improvements. Unfortunately, exclusive focus on these puts innovation in danger.</p>

<p>People should have the means to experiment. By far the greatest experimentation killer is carrots and stick management. If people live in fear of losing their job, we have no chance of becoming more agile.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Encouraging experimentation while sticking to compensation by objectives is schizophrenic.</p></blockquote>

<p>The situation is only slightly better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives">management by objectives</a>. One of the reason is that as people start to expect their bonus, they also start to fear not having it next year ! We&rsquo;re back at the fear problem. There&rsquo;s a more direct issue with MBO though. A good experiment should be ambitious and have a high likelihood of failure. Unfortunately, people will negotiate unambitious objectives, to secure their bonus. In the end, people do far too few bold experiments and don&rsquo;t raise problems to safeguard their bonuses. Eventually, both people and the organization fail to learn.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Punished-Rewards-Trouble-Incentive-Praise/dp/0618001816"><img src="../imgs/2018-01-11-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-3-what-to-do/punished-by-rewards.jpg" alt="Cover of the book &quot;Punished by rewards&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>Instead of using MBO, we need to find a different way to deal with compensation. The management 3.0 literature has plenty of ideas for that. For example :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://management30.com/practice/salary-formula/">Salary formula</a>. Some companies, like <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> use a <a href="https://buffer.com/salary">transparent formula</a> to compute everyone&rsquo;s compensation. This base salary is independent from any subjective performance evaluation. On top <a href="https://open.buffer.com/transparent-pay-revolution/">boosting motivation</a>, it provides plenty of room for experimentation.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><a href="https://qz.com/169147/applications-have-doubled-to-the-company-that-discloses-its-salaries/">After disclosing employee salaries, Buffer was inundated with resumes</a></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.holacracy.org/badge-based-compensation-app/">Badge-based compensation</a>. Holocracy describes how to take valuable skills into account in a salary formula. To get a badge on a topic, you need to be recognized by the people who already own this badge. Examples of badges can be &ldquo;UX Expert&rdquo; or &ldquo;Senior Software Engineer&rdquo;.</li>
<li><a href="https://management30.com/practice/merit-money/">Merit money</a>. Company profits redistribution to employees should be both motivating and fair. Instead of typical yearly bonuses, merit money is a crowd-sourced money allocation scheme. Everyone regularly receives a fixed amount of monkey money. You should give some back to a colleague who helped you. You could also give some to acknowledge someone else&rsquo;s great job. Every month a lottery is played to know if employees should receive their share of profits. If so, everyone gets his share in proportion with the monkey money they received. Otherwise, profits accumulate until the next lottery.</li>
</ul>


<p>We could worry that dropping MBO will drop people&rsquo;s motivation as well. It turns out it&rsquo;s the exact opposite ! Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFlvor6ZHdY">this talk</a> by Daniel Pinks to understand how bonuses kill motivation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second post in a <a href="/blog/categories/agile-transformations-fail-series/">series about making large organizations more agile</a>. I encourage you to <a href="/why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-1-the-situation/">start with the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s summarize the previous post. I illustrated the typical disappointment with large scale &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; transformations. At best they bring a small short term productivity improvement. At worst, they turn into micro-management.</p>

<h2>Why doesn&rsquo;t it work ?</h2>

<p>An organization is agile if it is able to respond and take advantage of changes fast. An organization where decisions need to go up and down the ladder will be slow. To thrive in this complex world, everyone needs to be able to take faster and bigger decisions. To do so, people need the good data, but also the right to fail, and the chance to learn new ways of working.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-01-09-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-2-the-problem/decision-making.jpg" alt="A sign post with 2 directions : a convoluted 'centralized decision making' road, and a simpler 'agile decision making' road" /></p>

<p>People with the right authority could make data available fast enough. Learning new habits and convincing every one of their right to fail takes time though.</p>

<h2>A safe environment</h2>

<p>In &ldquo;Turn the shop around&rdquo; Navy captain David Marquet explains how he empowered his crew. They would take decisions and inform him with &ldquo;I intend to &hellip;&rdquo;. Doing that, he also took on him the responsibility of his subordinates errors !</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404"><img src="../imgs/2018-01-09-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-2-the-problem/turn-the-ship-around.jpg" alt="Cover of the book &quot;Turn the ship around&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>There are always people who put the organization&rsquo;s interests before theirs. They will try new experiments, even if could backfire in their faces, because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. Unfortunately, these people are pretty rare. The vast majority will not try things that would get them troubles. They need a safe environment to unleash autonomy.</p>

<p>The typical adoption technique is to &ldquo;fake it until you make it&rdquo;. Apply the practices until the principles and values soak in everyone&rsquo;s mind. There&rsquo;s a catch though ! People need great models. People buy-in values, not actions. Think of Apple and other technology brands. People buy Apple hardware because they &ldquo;Think Different&rdquo; not for the products ! (Though I admit I love their products too :&ndash;))</p>

<p>Although people buy-in values, they measure them through actions. Leaders need to walk their talk for people to trust them.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 People buy-in values, but they measure them through actions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Very often, leaders stick to actions that communicate that it is <em>not ok</em> to fail. Like compensation by objectives for example. Or highlighting the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/commitment-vs-forecast-subtle-important-change-scrum">commitment</a> of sprints. Praising overwork is another one !</p>

<h2>Place to learn</h2>

<p>Real learning comes from experimentation.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 “Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed.” Maria Montessori</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Montessori"><img src="../imgs/2018-01-09-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-2-the-problem/Maria_Montessori.jpg" alt="Photograph of educator Maria Montessori" /></a></p>

<p>This is still true for adults at work. Every time management pushes top-down incentives to speed up change, general understanding suffers. There is a limit to what an organization can withstand before it falls prey to cargo cult.</p>

<p>Leaders must provide a safe environment. They must also provide the conditions for the teams to learn and improve their unique way of working.</p>

<p>Too often, leaders are in a hurry. &ldquo;Why should we waste our time rediscovering what others have already understood ? Let&rsquo;s apply Scrum (or SAFe or LeSS) !&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did you ever learn something by copying the results of others ?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> for example. It&rsquo;s a collection of proven best practices. That&rsquo;s only half of the story though. What&rsquo;s not clear is how a practice is proven to work ? By definition, a team had success with it before adding it to SAFe. It can only be the result of experimentation and learning, as it was not yet part of SAFe !</p>

<h2>In the end</h2>

<p>Many leaders embark their organization in an Agile transformation for some business benefits. Unfortunately, people often perceive that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the latest way to squeeze a bit more out of us all !&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It does not have to be that way. What if they followed massive decentralization of power. What if they made more data available ? What if they adapted the compensation scheme to encourage risk taking. What if they gave authority to their teams to experiment and learn from their own problems. Would people still feel it&rsquo;s just another re-org ? As a reference, see how <a href="https://www.solidarity-us.org/leanproduction">unions have been fighting lean manufacturing for decades</a>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll look into the next posts. This was part 2 of a <a href="/blog/categories/agile-transformations-fail-series/">series of posts on making large organizations more agile</a>. <a href="/why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-3-what-to-do/">Further posts</a> will propose what to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goose_That_Laid_the_Golden_Eggs">Aesop&rsquo;s famous tale</a>, a farmer kills his goose that lays a golden egg every day to get all the eggs at once. He finds no eggs, lost his goose, and remains poor ever after.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the same pattern happen many times in the software industry. A team decides to become more agile. After a few years of continuous improvement, it shows largely above average performances. Managers start to notice and ask how the team got there, to replicate this success. Unfortunately, they don&rsquo;t want to wait a few years for the other teams to find their own way. As a result, an &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; process is copy printed to all teams. Follows only ephemeral improvement, at the same time that the initial team gets drowned in a company &ldquo;Scaled Agile&rdquo; initiative &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-01-09-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-1-the-situation/lets-all-do-this-agile-thing.jpg" alt="Drawing of a street tag 'Let's all do this Agile thing !&quot;" /></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>In the 60&rsquo;s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Toyota">Toyota</a> was innovating new ways to build cars. Other car manufacturers used to visit the Toyota plants to understand how they did it. Toyota was welcoming them with open arms ! (You can still <a href="http://www.visittoyotaky.com/">visit Toyota plants</a> today) Fortunately for Toyota, none of the visitors managed to copy their results.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Competitors managed to copy Toyota&rsquo;s practices, but not their results !</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s think of other agile companies like Google, Apple or Spotify. Did they copy an existing Agile framework or recipe ? No, they rather learned to embrace change in their own way. The HP LaserJet team did not become more agile by sticking to best practices either, they also did it their own way.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Approach-Large-Scale-Agile-Development/dp/0321821726/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1515476483&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hp+large+scale+agile"><img src="../imgs/2018-01-09-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-1-the-situation/hp-large-scale-agile-dev.jpg" alt="The cover of &quot;A Practical Approach to Large-Scale Agile Development. How HP Transformed LaserJet FutureSmart Firmware&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>Thinking about it, I never read a single story of how a team succeeded by sticking to method X, Y or Z.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just not possible to be agile by strict adherence to a method. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s what most companies do. Have a look at the job posts, everyone is looking for agile devs, but do these companies look agile once you are in ?</p>

<h2>What are the actual results ?</h2>

<p>With a move to &ldquo;Agile&rdquo;, management usually envisions some of the following benefits :</p>

<ul>
<li>better quality</li>
<li>increased productivity through waste reduction</li>
<li>more innovation</li>
</ul>


<p>People who want these changes fast don&rsquo;t understand what they are doing. If they were, they would not expect this to be fast. It&rsquo;s all too easy to see &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; as a method, or a process.</p>

<p>Following the traditional <a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/">&ldquo;machine&rdquo; organization metaphor</a>, processes are to be applied ! Deploying the new &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; process, leaves little room for self-organization and empowerment. People throughout the organization perceive it as yet another reorganization. People still feel like cogs in the machine. Cogs don&rsquo;t show a lot of autonomy and motivation ! That&rsquo;s when the vicious circle kicks in. To fix the lack of drive, management adds more top-down process !</p>

<p>Long story short, these transformations bring very little improvements. At the beginning, when everyone is keeping a close look at the process, things will go a bit better. A few month later, things will get back to where they were.</p>

<blockquote><p><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/JAoAahDozJKWD5?startSlide=13" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/ThoughtWorks/lean-enterprise-how-to-innovate-at-scale" title="Lean Enterprise - Enabling Innovative Culture" target="_blank">Lean Enterprise &ndash; Enabling Innovative Culture</a> </strong> de <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/ThoughtWorks" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a></strong> </div></p></blockquote>

<p>A specific danger of &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; is that it can serve micro-management. Short iterations, code reviews and other feedback practices puts everyone under the radar. This makes decision makers feel more in control, at the cost of motivation and innovation. As an example, check <a href="http://sceptical-meerkat.blogspot.fr/2016/12/pair-programming-whats-in-it-for-me.html">this post</a> from a pair programming sceptic.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; can easily slip into micro-management</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the forth and last post of a <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">series about the #ZeroBugs policy</a>. In the <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/">previous posts</a>, I detailed how we applied it in our team, what were the consequences and how you could do the same.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a catch though, even if you are sure that <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/no_bugs.html">#ZeroBugs</a> is a good thing, people around you might not agree ! As with any kind of change, one of the trickiest thing is overcoming people&rsquo;s fear about your idea. This post will be about dealing with people&rsquo;s resistance.</p>

<h2>A few general change advices</h2>

<p>With time, I discovered general best practices to bring change. The first is that you are much more likely to get your ideas through if you are nice with people ! In a bit more details, this means that :</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to help people, for real !</li>
<li>Listen to their concerns instead of pushing your idea</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t blame people if they don&rsquo;t see the value of your idea</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 Change agent&rsquo;s advice #1 : be nice with people</p></blockquote>

<p>Another invaluable trick is to be patient : change takes time. Finally, if you are stuck, suggest testing your idea for a while, people are more likely to adopt it this way.</p>

<h2>Winning the devs over</h2>

<p>Back to our particular #ZeroBugs issue. In this particular case, I would  try to convince the devs first. Reason A is that without them onboard, the practice won&rsquo;t work as well as expected. Reason B is that it is more difficult for management to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to a full team than to a single developer.</p>

<p>Developers will fear spending too much time fixing bugs. Sell them long term fixes instead of dirty quick fixes. Stress that it will be a chance to refactor important, poorly designed parts of the system. Also explain that once the bug backlog is clean, they&rsquo;ll spend more time on new developments.</p>

<p>A last argument for developers is about clarifying prioritization. Pushing bug triage to business people will save devs from feature creep. That should save them from some stress of not delivering.</p>

<h2>Winning business people over</h2>

<p>They&rsquo;ll fear that fixing bugs will reduce the delivery of valuable features. Indeed, if done without care, this is a real danger. Highlight the value of bug fixing : it improves the product and image of the company. Fixing bugs also increases feature delivery in the long run. It does so by removing some recurring support issues and fixing technical debt.</p>

<p>Also point out that they&rsquo;ll have more visibility and control over what is being worked on by the team. This is an opportunity for them to increase the value throughput.</p>

<p>They might also have concerns about the time to spend categorizing bugs. Make sure to get this as streamlined as possible. For example, if they are very busy, you could pre-categorize the issues to make it easier for them.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-we-got-to-zero-bugs-and-implemented-a-zero-bug-policy-c77ee3f2e50b">this blog post</a>, Andrew Fulton explains how he convinced his boss to adopt a #ZeroBugs policy.</p>

<h2>Last words</h2>

<blockquote><p>💡 #ZeroBugs policy makes work more sustainable</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m done with this <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">series about #ZeroBugs policy</a>. I hope I convinced you to give it a try. The developer&rsquo;s life is better without bugs ! If you do, or if you already did, I&rsquo;d love to read about it. Thanks a lot for reading me so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the third post of a <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">series about the #ZeroBugs policy</a>. In the <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/">first 2 posts</a>, I detailed how we applied it in our team, and what were the consequences.</p>

<p>I hope that by now, I have convinced you that applying a <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/no_bugs.html">#ZeroBugs</a> policy is good for you and your team. I&rsquo;ll surprise you by arguing that it&rsquo;s a lot easier than people first think. This post will be about how to inject it in your team.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-3/zero-bug-formula.jpg" alt="A funny formula for zero bugs" /></p>

<h2>Build quality in</h2>

<p>Obviously, you need a low bug rate for this work. If your team creates too many bugs, fixing incoming bugs only will consume all your time. You won&rsquo;t be able to deliver new features and it will make everyone miserable.</p>

<p>If you are in this situation, I&rsquo;d advice you to start investing in coding best practices such as :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.fr/search?q=how+to+start+Continuous+Integration&amp;oq=how+to+start+Continuous+Integration">Continuous Integration</a></li>
<li><a href="/how-to-start-learning-the-tao-of-incremental-code-refactoring-today/">Test Driven Development</a></li>
<li><a href="/how-to-get-your-team-to-do-code-reviews/">Code reviews</a></li>
<li><a href="/from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/">Pair programming</a></li>
<li><a href="/how-to-start-learning-the-tao-of-incremental-code-refactoring-today/">Refactoring</a></li>
</ul>


<p>With grit and time, your bug rate will get down.</p>

<h2>New bugs</h2>

<p>Before dealing with the old bugs, you should first put in place the target policy for new bugs. Don&rsquo;t let the situation get worse !</p>

<p>The way to deal with new bugs is to setup a regular (at least weekly) routine to decide what to do about them :</p>

<ul>
<li>If it&rsquo;s causing real pain to someone and needs a fix as soon as possible, then it&rsquo;s very likely to be a bug</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s something important you can still live without for a few sprints, change it to a story in the backlog.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s not that important now, delete or archive it as &ldquo;won&rsquo;t fix&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>From then on, the new convention is fix all bugs before working on features. This ensures that the bugs backlog will not grow anymore. If you need more details about how to categorize issues, take a look at what <a href="https://medium.com/quality-functions/the-zero-bug-policy-b0bd987be684">Sam Hatoum says about that</a>.</p>

<p>Different people will provide different perspectives on issues. Business people will know their business value. Developers will know fix&rsquo;s impact on technical debt. Finally, service desk people will know how much time they would save with the fix. Depending on your situation, involve the right people in the classification.</p>

<p>Another approach is to do as we did, and come up with clear rules that define what a bug is. This has the advantage of allowing developers to categorize issues on their own. The drawback is that it can be very tricky to come up with these rules.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Agree on rules for categorizing bugs with your users to streamline your flow</p></blockquote>

<h2>Old bugs</h2>

<p>Ok, that was the easy part. How can we deal with the zillions bugs we all have waiting in the backlog ? Depending on the size of your bug backlog, you should adopt different strategies.</p>

<p>If you have a rather small bug debt, as we did, you can get away by prioritizing X bugs every sprint.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose you have a larger bug debt. You could do as <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-we-got-to-zero-bugs-and-implemented-a-zero-bug-policy-c77ee3f2e50b">ConceptShare did</a> and crank out a feature team dedicated to eliminate bugs. That should work, but it will take some time. It took the ConceptShare teams 18 months to get rid of a 350 bugs backlog !</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to take a look at all existing bugs to re-classify some as stories and delete others. Just as you should now be doing with new bugs. This should drastically reduce the number of bugs, but it will take some time from very busy people &hellip; Again, rules to define what a bug is would make this easier.</p>

<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s a last, very effective solution : archive all the bugs ! Some bugs must be months if not years old. Deleting them should not do much harm. Users will report important bugs again anyway. One caveat though : this won&rsquo;t work if your bug rate is too high ! If quality is too low, you&rsquo;ll drawn under old bug.</p>

<h2>Going further</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Explore-Increase-Confidence-Exploratory-Testing/dp/1937785025/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511346285&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=explore+it"><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-3/explore-it.jpg" alt="Cover of the book &quot;Explore It&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to fix the bugs very fast. It&rsquo;s even better if to fix them before the users see them ! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing">Exploratory testing</a> is the way to do that. It will also provide you a measure of how many bugs escape your development process. I encourage you to try this very interesting practice. I wrote <a href="/how-we-started-exploratory-testing/">a guide</a> about how to start exploratory testing.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Exploratory Testing gives you a quantifiable measure of your workflow</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second post of a <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">series about the #ZeroBugs policy</a>. In the <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/">previous post</a>, I detailed what a <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/no_bugs.html">#ZeroBugs</a> policy is and how we tried to apply it. I encourage you start <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/">there</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a quick summary of where we stood. We had tried to apply a #ZeroBugs policy with exploratory testing. We had discovered a lot of bugs, and we had agreed to tackle them little by little. We hoped to finish in a few months.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-2/bug-panic.jpg" alt="The Bug Panic game" /></p>

<h2>The final bug rules</h2>

<p>At about the same time, we started an improvement kata to increase our productivity. I wrote in details about <a href="/how-we-used-the-improvement-kata-to-gain-25-percent-of-productivity-part-1/">the full story</a>, but to make it short, here is what we discovered :</p>

<ul>
<li>It would take us years, not months to fix all our bugs</li>
<li>Our definition for bugs was part of the problem</li>
</ul>


<p>After some experimentation, here is the bug definition we came up with :</p>

<ul>
<li>It corrupts data</li>
<li>It returns wrong results</li>
<li>It crashes with an unexpected error message</li>
</ul>


<p>It stopped scope creep by removing the subjective &ldquo;it used to work&rdquo; rule. This rule also sped up bug fixing a lot. We closed many bugs with descriptive error messages.</p>

<h2>Consequences</h2>

<p>Within 2 sprints, we reached a #ZeroBugs state. Backlog &lsquo;management&rsquo; was simpler as it did not contain bugs anymore. We were also spending less time fixing bugs and more building stories. Even as we resumed our intense exploratory testing sessions, our bug backlog did not grow.</p>

<p>After a while, we discovered other benefits to the #ZeroBugs policy.</p>

<p>Spending less time on bugs made our velocity more stable. Our product owner was happier to see us deliver new features more reliably. In the end, this improved our relationship with him. </p>

<blockquote><p>💡 #ZeroBugs policy makes developers happier</p></blockquote>

<p>It also made the team happier. First, because we had a lot less of stressful emergencies to answer to. Second, because programming new features is more interesting than fixing bugs.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-2/happy-developer.jpg" alt="A relaxed developer" /></p>

<p>It also made the other teams happier and more productive ! They encountered a lot less bugs when using our product. When they had problems, they usually got a clear error message. They would fix it on their side, or suggest us a new feature.</p>

<p>A #ZeroBugs policy and exploratory testing also have a side effect on technical debt ! Bugs tend to appear in the more brittle parts of the code. When fixing bugs, you took the opportunity to refactor technical debt at the same time.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 #ZeroBugs policy reduces technical debt</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, having a definition for bugs was very helpful. It allowed decentralized prioritization of bugs. The alternative to that is to have a domain expert available to sort bugs from stories. A decentralized rule prevents all sort of coordination and people issues. Our system was rather technical, which made it easy to define what a bug is. In other cases, it might be worth spending some time with the domain expert to define similar rules.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Use decision rules to decentralize economic control.&rdquo; From <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation-ebook/dp/B007TKU0O0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511344068&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=reinertsen+flow">Principles of Product Development Flow</a> by <a href="http://reinertsenassociates.com/">Donald G. Reinertsen</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To summarize, sticking to #ZeroBugs is a win-win and sustainable situation for all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some teams spend 95% of their development time fixing bugs &hellip; An entrepreneur I worked with reported an even scarier story. He went bankrupt because bugs were taking <em>all</em> the development time. He had no time left for new features !</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, some <a href="http://leanagilepartners.com/library/Vanschooenderwoert-EmbeddedNumbers.pdf">eXtreme Programming teams</a> reported bug rates as low as 1.5 per month !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Some XP teams reported bug rates as low as 1.5 per month !</p></blockquote>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great for everyone if we had less bugs to fix ? Programmers would do more interesting work. Business people would get more valuable features. People would do less overtime. All this while users get a better product !</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/aim-bug.jpg" alt="A bug in a viewfinder" /></p>

<p>Last year, in my team, we reached and maintained a #ZeroBugs state. Here is how we did it.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/no_bugs.html">#ZeroBugs</a> policy</h2>

<p>Before we jump into our story, let&rsquo;s take a second to understand what this is all about.</p>

<p>Bugs waste time. They waste the time of users, who can&rsquo;t do what they need. They waste everyone&rsquo;s time with interruptions from unhappy user. They steal time from new features development. If you have a large number of known bugs, you&rsquo;ll also waste some time organizing them : eliminating duplicates, prioritizing them, ignoring others &hellip;</p>

<p>A #ZeroBugs policy is the convention of having no bugs in your backlog. This means that when someone finds a defect, it should be immediately :</p>

<ul>
<li>fixed before any other feature</li>
<li>prioritized as a new story</li>
<li>or ignored (for the moment)</li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously, the less bug you create the easier this will be.</p>

<h2>Our journey to a #ZeroBugs policy</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>We were an R&amp;D team, building a data management system. Our product was moving outside of pure research and development. Other teams were starting to use it and often reported bugs back to us.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d first read about #ZeroBugs in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-Pragmatic-Software/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511342870&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile">The Art of Agile Software Development</a>. Given enough automated testing, XP teams could almost stop doing bug fixing !</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-Pragmatic-Software/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511342870&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile"><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/art-of-agile.jpg" alt="Cover of the book &quot;The Art of Agile Software Development&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>As we had very solid automated testing in place, we decided to take the extra steps to save time on bug fixing.</p>

<h3>First attempt</h3>

<p>There is a straightforward way to install a #ZeroBugs policy. Make sure to have a customer or a Product Owner to prioritize defects as soon as they appear (check <a href="https://medium.com/quality-functions/the-zero-bug-policy-b0bd987be684">this story</a> for an example).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this would not work for us. Our Product Owner was great at providing us with a long term vision. He could not be available for day to day bug prioritization though.</p>

<p>Our first try was to propose a definition for bugs that we could use ourselves to classify them. We decided that something was a bug if either of the following was true :</p>

<ul>
<li>It corrupts data.</li>
<li>It returns wrong results. As we were building a data management system, this was rather easy to verify.</li>
<li>It used to work but is now broken</li>
</ul>


<p>Whenever we found an issue meeting any of these points, we would start working on it straightaway.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Exploratory testing goes hand in hand with #ZeroBugs policy</p></blockquote>

<p>To speed up downstream integration of our product by other teams, we also <a href="/how-we-started-exploratory-testing/">started Exploratory Testing</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing">Exploratory testing</a> is a practice that goes hand in hand with a #ZeroBugs policy.</p>

<h3>Unearthing a bug debt</h3>

<p>During the first exploratory testing session, we found more than 10 bugs. We thought that with a bit of focus we could fix all lingering bugs in a few weeks max &hellip; After 2 other sessions and more than one sprint of intense bug fixing, we had even unearthed more bugs. We were wrong, this would take a lot more than a few weeks.</p>

<p>If we kept on our 1 hour exploratory testing sessions every sprint, we would fill our backlog with bugs. We would also be fixing bugs for a few months before we could tackle any new feature !</p>

<p>We agreed on the following strategy to fix all these bugs little by little :</p>

<ul>
<li>stop these intense exploratory testing sessions</li>
<li>do shorter exploratory testing sessions at the end of every story</li>
<li>fix 5 to 6 bugs every sprint</li>
</ul>


<p>We hoped to fix all our bugs in a few months.</p>

<h2>Next week</h2>

<p>That was the first part of <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">a series of posts about #ZeroBugs policy</a>. In the <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-2/">next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll explain how we dealt with this bug debt and dig into the consequences it had on our work.</p>

<p>My <a href="/are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/">last post</a> detailed how prioritization and Work In Progress limits are the keys to less work and higher productivity.</p>

<h2>The best jam is made in old jars</h2>

<p>As I was writing the post, I could not stop thinking :</p>

<blockquote><p>Once again, XP has been addressing these WIP and prioritization issues for 20 years now !</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see exactly how.</p>

<h3>WIP limitation</h3>

<p>XP has a drastic way to reduce WIP by 2 : pair programming. Instead of 6 developers taking on 6 stories at the same time, they only tackle 3. I won&rsquo;t dive into the ton of other advantages to pair programming here. If you want to learn more, these <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/pair-programming/">blog posts</a> might help.</p>

<p>Although it is now seen as a Scrum practice, Planning Game was part of original XP. Sticking to a basic planning game will give room for slack at the end of iterations. The trick is to leave the <a href="https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2">infamous focus factor</a> away.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 A simple planning game will give room for slack.</p></blockquote>

<p>Suppose a team member takes vacations for a sprint. The team should deliver less user stories that sprint. They&rsquo;ll have less story points to schedule on next sprint. This leaves room for slack and long term improvements such as refactoring, learning &hellip; If half the team goes on holiday, that&rsquo;s a different story, adapt your schedule with gut feeling.</p>

<p>A funny aspect of this is that XP teams are now the most likely to switch to the more extreme <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates">#NoEstimates</a>.</p>

<h3>Priorities</h3>

<p>XP&rsquo;s on-site customer is a straightforward way to work only on the most valuable features. Who better than an end user would be able to make this estimation ?</p>

<p>The YAGNI (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">You Ain&rsquo;t Gonna Need It</a>) and simple design principles avoid building unnecessary features. TDD&rsquo;s strict point of not writing code before a failing test prevents over-engineering.</p>

<h2>Modern XP</h2>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/221024846" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>In this wonderful talk from <a href="http://rachelcdavies.github.io/">Rachel C. Davies</a>, she presents how her team has been improving XP for 15 years. She explains how they organize as 2 mobs and 1 solo. At any moment, one mob is working on stories. The other mob works on important long term technical improvements. The solo does some learning. This is an even greater WIP reduction technique than pair programming.</p>

<p>Having a dev doing learning all the time is a form of continuous slack. If the team feels that they cannot deliver something by an important date, he can join the mob to help them.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s even more to this learning. It can be about anything. Developers work on their technical skills, but they also learn about the domain. Little by little this turns them into domain experts. Guess what : domain experts are great at optimizing value !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 With time and efforts, developers can become domain experts !</p></blockquote>

<h2>Afterthoughts</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to prove the long term productivity of XP. We cannot split the world to run the same project with and without XP. Another difficulty is that after a years of XP, work remains smooth and sustainable. Nothing like crunch mode. People used to the hero culture are hard to convince that they can be more productive by doing less.</p>

<p>Hopefully, lean theory and gut feeling of programmers who have switched to XP can back up my claims.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the last 15 years, I&rsquo;ve worked in many different teams. Every team has its own way of working. I&rsquo;ve been at places where everyone seemed busy all the time. Did we deliver more ? No. Often quite the opposite ! The most productive teams I&rsquo;ve been in used to do no more than 6 hours of solid work every day &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-20-are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/dev-in-mouse-wheel.jpg" alt="A developer in a mouse wheel" /></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the reason behind that ?</h2>

<p>In Lean Management theory, lead time is the time it takes to get a feature from customer request to delivery. Here is a graph that draws typical lead time over factory load (1 &ndash; idle time percentage).</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-20-are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/cycle-time-vs-utilization.jpg" alt="A graph of the lead time versus utilization" /></p>

<p>What does all this tell us ? </p>

<p>When utilization becomes too high, people start multitasking. As multitasking increases, productivity drops, delaying projects. As a consequence, products are late to hit the market. On the other side, a low utilization means paying people to be idle. That might put any company out of business. Factory managers&#8217; best practice is to limit Work In Progress by loading their assembly lines around 80%. Not too high to avoid over-utilization, but not too low to avoid wasting time.</p>

<p>Every software product is new product development (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Iterative-Development-Managers-Guide/dp/0131111558/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509112918&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=larman+a+manager%27s+guide">Craig Larman</a>). As such, they are way less predictable than any assembly line. It means we need more slack to absorb unexpected variations (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation-ebook/dp/B007TKU0O0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509112980&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=reinertsen+flow">Donald G. Reinertsen</a>). This tells us that we should have more than 20% of slack in our schedules and plannings. Unfortunately, overloading and multitasking is a wide spread disease in the software world.</p>

<h2>How to get rid of task switching ?</h2>

<p>The answer is obvious : prioritization ! Only work on the most important item at a time. It&rsquo;s not because we start everything now that they&rsquo;ll sell them earlier ! It&rsquo;s quite the opposite in fact !</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-20-are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/concurrent-vs-sequential.jpg" alt="A comparision of sequential and concurrent product development" /></p>

<p>Here is another advantage to prioritization. It decreases the time between start and completion of a feature. This, in turn, decreases the likelihood of building something obsolete.</p>

<p>One last thing about prioritization &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-20-are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/Cost-of-Delay-distribution.png" alt="A graph of values of features in decreasing order" /><div class="image-credits"><a href="http://blackswanfarming.com/experience-report-maersk-line/">&ldquo;Black Swan Farming Using Cost of Delay&rdquo;</a> Joshua J.Arnold and Özlem Yüce</div></p>

<p>This graph tells us that a small fraction of the features bring most of the value, while a very large portion of the features bring almost no value &hellip; As puzzling as this graph may be, it&rsquo;s also a wonderful opportunity. If we manage to focus one the most valuable features only, we can save a ton of work, while being more effective ! <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean startup</a> and market research are techniques to identify these features up-front.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 You don&rsquo;t need more time, you just need to decide ! Seth Godin</p></blockquote>

<h2>Culture issue</h2>

<p>Becoming more effective by banning overtime, enforcing monotasking and being serious about prioritizing ? These ideas are heresy in some workplaces ! Have a look around you. Are people overworked ? Are they fire fighting all the time ? Are they drowning in multitasking ? If it&rsquo;s the case, I bet there&rsquo;s a wide scale lack of prioritization issue at your workplace.</p>

<p>People at the top of the company need to control the overall WIP. If they don&rsquo;t, multitasking will catch you up, however you try to escape it. Multitasking can be obvious e.g., when we need to work on different projects at the same time. It can also sneak in as maintenance, or unrelated meetings marathons. Another symptom is when developers need to take on &ldquo;submarine&rdquo; refactoring initiatives. From experience, that&rsquo;s often the case in sales driven companies. Where any customer request is agreed and sold, regardless of the company&rsquo;s capacity.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Require​ ​everyone​ ​in​ ​product​ ​and​ ​engineering​ ​to​ ​read​ ​​Principles​ ​of​ ​Product​ ​Development​ ​Flow by Donald Reinertsen. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-do-we-go-faster-ed51207952a8">John Cutler</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting parallel in the Stephen R. Covey&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/7-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0935721800/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509113465&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=7+habits+of">7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>. He says we should drop the urgent and not important for the important and not urgent. In software term, it means spending time on important and long term work rather than short term stuff. We should do more refactoring, hiring, training and continuous improvement. We should stoping building features we are not sure of the value.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s summarize. Here are my advices to work less and be more productive. Enforce hard WIP limits at all levels. Do serious prioritization. Provide enough slack. In my <a href="/sustainable-productivity-in-extreme-programming/">next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll show how XP addresses these issues.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/distributed-teams-remote-collaboration">Far From the mobbing crowd</a> the <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a> guys explain how they combined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming">mob programming</a> and remote work. <a href="https://twitter.com/mattwynne?lang=fr">Matt</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tooky?lang=fr">Steve</a> also explain that a mob is both resilient and fast. They explain that they sometimes have to leave the mob for 15 minutes or so. When they come back the code has changed a lot ! It&rsquo;s as if the mob continues no matter who&rsquo;s in.</p>

<p>One of them then suggests an idea. </p>

<blockquote><p>With enough people around the world, we could run a mob that never stops!</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-12-mobbing-around-the-world-for-48h-dot-dot-dot-whos-in/mob-drawing.jpg" alt="A drawing of a mob walking around a binary world" /></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the point ?</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/">The Ultimate Guide To Remote Work</a> the <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> team explains how to take advantage of time zones and remote work. We can get a feature done faster by having a pair of programmers from different time zones work on it ! Instead of a single day of work in 24h, you get 2 ! We could get features in half the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/"><img src="../imgs/2017-10-12-mobbing-around-the-world-for-48h-dot-dot-dot-whos-in/ultimate-guide-remote-work.png" alt="The cover of The Ultimate Guide To Remote Work" /></a></p>

<p>In Lean Management, the time to get a feature is called the cycle time. A short cycle time has a lot of benefits. You get feedback faster. The needs of the users have less risk of changing. You&rsquo;ll get less interruptions, which increases your focus and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Zapier found that time zones and remote work can divide the cycle time by 2. This is already a major improvement. Let&rsquo;s replace this pair of programmers by a mob ! The cucumber guys explain that 4 hours of mobbing is about the most someone can do in a single day. With a mob of 5 people at any time, that&rsquo;s around :</p>

<p><em>24/4 * 5 = 30</em></p>

<p>30 developers working on the same feature, full time !</p>

<p>What would be the effect of this on cycle time ? I don&rsquo;t expect it to cut the cycle time by 30, but from my experience with pairing, I&rsquo;d still expect a drastic reduction. Imagine a complex feature that you estimated to 30 days to finish. Could it be done in less than a week ?</p>

<p>Working on a single story at a time, we could forget merges and complex CIs ! More generally, it would lead to an important Work In Progress (WIP) reduction. Very related to cycle time, reducing the WIP also brings a lot of improvements. One of the most important is an increased throughput. <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/deliver-software-faster-by-managing-work-in-progress-not-by-adding-overtime">Here</a> is a great article detailing the benefits of reducing the WIP.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Mob programming reduces WIP and cycle time</p></blockquote>

<p>And what about the team structure ? Could a team of 30 be effective in this setting ? 7 is the magic count for a team size. If we could grow past this number, we could imagine completely new org charts :</p>

<ul>
<li>More decentralized</li>
<li>More resilient </li>
<li>Less synchronization and coordination overhead</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/distributed-teams-remote-collaboration"><img src="../imgs/2017-10-12-mobbing-around-the-world-for-48h-dot-dot-dot-whos-in/far-from-mobbing-crowd.jpg" alt="A screen capture of 'Far from the mobbing crowd'" /></a></p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s try it !</h2>

<p>As any new idea, it&rsquo;s also very likely to fail miserably &hellip; The communication overhead could turn out overwhelming. The mob might not be resilient to frequent changes after all. It could work but not bring any reduction to cycle time. There is a ton of reasons for this to fail.</p>

<p>The best way to find out is to try !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Stupid ideas that work become great ideas. [<a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/tricks/pick-something-stupid/">XP moto</a>]</p></blockquote>

<p>We just need to find enough people spread around the world to give it a try. Could we do 48 hours straight of mobbing and go twice around the globe ?</p>

<p>We would need people distributed across all time zones. Pairing and incremental design would be de-facto practices. It would work better with people used to XP.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d need at least a mob of 3 doing 5h of mobbing per day for 2 days. That would be :</p>

<p><em>24/5*3 = 15</em></p>

<p>We could go with 15 people but 30 would be ideal. Once we have enough volunteers, we&rsquo;ll have to agree on a few other things :</p>

<ul>
<li>A date for the experiment</li>
<li>A subject we can all understand</li>
<li>Technologies and tools to use</li>
<li>A time-schedule</li>
</ul>


<p>There&rsquo;s nothing impossible here !</p>

<h2>Call for volunteers</h2>

<p>If you want to participate, leave a comment below or contact me through <a href="https://twitter.com/pbourgau">twitter</a>. I&rsquo;ll keep you updated about the status of the experiment.</p>

<p>One last thing &hellip; as you&rsquo;ve guessed this is an experiment, not paid work. Anything we would produce will be open sourced on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
