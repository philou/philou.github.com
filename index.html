  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">My last post</a> was about the challenge for dev teams to get sponsorship for large scale refactorings. I listed two main reasons :</p>

<ol>
<li>The business doubts developers to have their interests in mind</li>
<li>They are also not aware of the cost of the current technical debt</li>
</ol>


<p>This post (and the next) will be about how to gain the business&rsquo;s trust. This is exactly where badass developers can help. Let me start with a story.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-06-27-why-we-need-badass-developers-to-perform-large-scale-refactorings/badass-dev.jpg" alt="Drawing of 2 hands of a badass developer over his keyboard, with &quot;&gt;badass&lt;&quot; tatooed on his fingers" /></p>

<p>Back in 2002, at my first job, I started to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8">Refactoring, Improving the Design of Existing code</a>. That&rsquo;s where I read about unit testing. I found it so great that I made a demo to other programmers. Being the junior dev in the team, my co-workers reaction was something between &ldquo;Meh&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maybe&rdquo;. Fortunately, a more experienced and respected developer gave it a try. A few weeks after my demo, he announced to the team that unit testing worked great on new code. This time, people showed no questioning about his opinion : he if said so, it must have been true. Even business people blessed the practice !</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8"><img src="../imgs/2018-06-27-why-we-need-badass-developers-to-perform-large-scale-refactorings/refactoring.jpg" alt="The &quot;Refactoring, improving the design of existing code&quot; cover. Badass developers know how to perform large scale refactoring" /></a></p>

<p>I had given a good live coding demo, but it was this respected developer&rsquo;s opinion that won the point. To convince business people of sponsoring a large scale refactoring, we need their trust. That&rsquo;s why we need badass developers around.</p>

<h2>What is a badass developer</h2>

<p>Badass developers are first of all people who are credible to the business. This usually implies a track record of <a href="/real-developers-ship/">delivering features</a> and refactorings. Badass developers understand the business constraints. That&rsquo;s why they learned how to deliver <a href="/7-reasons-why-learning-refactoring-techniques-will-improve-your-life-as-a-software-engineer/">refactorings alongside features</a>. They also need to be responsible and bold enough to <a href="/are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/">stand ground in front of the business</a>. Finally, badass developers are able to train others.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Badass developers are first of all people who are credible to the business</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, there are not so many badass developers in the industry &hellip; <a href="/developer-are-you-losing-your-rat-race/">It has a youngster bias</a>, and tends to push experienced developers to other activities. As if 10 years of systems design was less valuable than knowing the latest language !</p>

<h2>Learn more about Badasss developers</h2>

<p>I tried to find other words before resorting to &lsquo;Badass&rsquo;. Unfortunately, I could find none that got the point so clearly. <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/">Uncle bob</a> calls them &lsquo;software professionals&rsquo; in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8">The Clean Coder</a>. Professionalism is not specific enough to me. Adam Nowak also calls them &lsquo;responsible developers&rsquo; in a <a href="https://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/03/28/how-to-be-a-responsible-developer/">blog post</a>.  That does not convey the idea that, sometimes devs need to stand guard in front of the business.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8"><img src="../imgs/2018-06-27-why-we-need-badass-developers-to-perform-large-scale-refactorings/clean-coder.jpg" alt="The clean coder book cover. Clean coder looks like a form of badass developer" /></a></p>

<p>These concepts, though, are very close to my definition of a badass developer. Check by yourself :</p>

<h2>To be continued</h2>

<p>This was why badass developers matter to the success of large scale refactorings. This was the second post in a <a href="/blog/categories/large-scale-refactoring-sponsorship-series/">series about how to get sponsorship for a large scale refactoring</a>.  In the next post, we&rsquo;ll look at what we can do to all become Badass developers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whenever I present or suggest a good practice to dev teams, I often get the same remark. Here is how it goes :</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>That&rsquo;s a great idea and we would love to do this, but our code is in such a mess that we cannot !</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe you should start doing more refactoring then !</p></li>
<li><p>We would like to, but we don&rsquo;t have the time. We are fire fighting all the time.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like the old adage of the lumberjack that is too busy to cut wood to sharpen his axe&hellip; The sad part here, is that most of the time, developers know they would be a lot faster if they could clean up their code. Unfortunately, they are usually not given the time.</p>

<h2>How do we end up in this silly situation ?</h2>

<p><a href="../imgs/2018-06-15-how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/why-are-large-scale-refactorings-not-prioritized.jpg"><img src="../imgs/2018-06-15-how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/why-are-large-scale-refactorings-not-prioritized-small.jpg" alt="Drawing of a '5 whys' mind map explaining why it is difficult to get sponsorship for a large scale refactoring" /></a></p>

<h3>Only developers see the bad code</h3>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve <a href="/the-size-of-code/">already been joking about</a>, code is invisible. Mess in the code even more so, especially to people who don&rsquo;t code. The code could look like that and no one would notice.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_syndrome"><img src="../imgs/2018-06-15-how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/Syllogomanie-Puteaux.jpg" alt="Inside of a kitchen from someone suffering from Diogenes syndrome" /></a></p>

<br>


<p>If someone put his own office in that state, he would get fired, but not for the source code. The good side is that we, developers, are safe, we can continue to wreak chaos without fear ! That&rsquo;s pretty weird when we think that this is what we ship to customers &hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_syndrome">Diogenes syndrome</a> for source code a recognized pathology ?</p></blockquote>

<p>Business might also not see bad code because that&rsquo;s the only thing they&rsquo;re used to ! Maybe they&rsquo;ve always been working in dysfunctional organizations that systematically create crappy code. Slow teams, late deliveries and fire fighting might be business as usual for them. From this point of view, trying to improve code is a pure waste of time and energy. The same goes for large scale refactorings.</p>

<p>The worse part of all this is that if devs don&rsquo;t have the time to keep their code clean, it will only get worse. This will reinforce the view that software delivery is slow and that there is nothing to do about it !</p>

<h3>Business has been burnt in the past !</h3>

<p>Bad experiences are another reason why business is unwilling to sponsor refactoring. Did someone sell them an unrealistic productivity boost that turned in a never-ending tunnel project ? Badly managed large scale refactorings deliver late, create no value, and a lot of bugs. At one company I worked for, business gave devs 1 full year (!) to clean up the code &hellip; We took 2 !! Meanwhile, the CEO had to dilute the stocks a bit to keep the boat afloat ! I&rsquo;d think twice before giving this kind of mandate myself.</p>

<p>Performing a large scale refactoring is not easy, and involves specific skills. These skills are about refactoring in baby steps, alongside feature delivery.</p>

<p>Usually, people acquire these skills through hard won experience &hellip; Unfortunately for us, our industry is not very nice to experienced engineers &hellip; It&rsquo;s a lot easier to hire a fresh grad who knows the latest javascript framework than a 2 decades engineer. (Who, BTW, could learn this framework in 2 weeks &hellip;) It&rsquo;s also a lot harder for the junior developer to succeed in negotiating a refactoring.</p>

<p>Again the twist of fate is that junior engineers are a lot more likely to start a submarine latest-framework.js rewrite supposed to solve all maintenance issues &hellip; which will only make things worse.</p>

<h2>Overestimate, only as last resort</h2>

<p>A quick fix is to systematically overestimate to get enough time to refactor. As any other &lsquo;submarine&rsquo; initiative, I would recommend it only in last resort, after you&rsquo;ve tried every other possible technique &hellip; and just before you quit.</p>

<p>Hiding things to the business people kills trust and hides problems. Trust and collaboration is what you need to get the business to sponsor large scale refactorings ! Plus, if ever you mess up (as submarine initiative often do) you&rsquo;ll be the only one to blame &hellip;</p>

<p>That said, &lsquo;overestimating&rsquo; so that you can write clean code is ok. It&rsquo;s not overestimating, it&rsquo;s estimating to do a good job.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 We should never ask the permission to do a good job. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfWCRl75Kas">Doc Norton</a>)</p></blockquote>

<h2>To be continued</h2>

<p>You might wonder what these other techniques are ! That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ll go through with the next posts. This was the first one in a <a href="/blog/categories/large-scale-refactoring-sponsorship-series/">series about how to get sponsorship for a large scale refactoring</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the chance to attend <a href="https://www.devoxx.fr/">Devoxx France</a> this year in Paris. Here is the most important lesson I learned :</p>

<blockquote><p>How to avoid unnecessary meetings with asynchronous decision making</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bdelacretaz">Bertrand Delacretaz</a>, a member of the Apache foundation. He gave a great talk about how the open source community handles decision taking. Open source developers are often all over the world, often in different timezones. Meetings are not an option for them. Still, they manage to make great decisions !</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-06-05-how-to-avoid-unnecessary-meetings-a-takeaway-from-devoxx-france-2018/decision.jpg" alt="Drawing of a decision hammer" /></p>

<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t work remotely, avoiding unnecessary meetings is always a great thing !</p>

<ol>
<li>You&rsquo;ll have more time to do productive and interesting stuff</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll avoid interruptions and be even more productive</li>
<li>If you are an introvert, it&rsquo;s going to be easier to contribute to the decision</li>
<li>As people have more time to think through the decision, the result is usually better</li>
</ol>


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xkC4zjtAyRc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>For a full walkthrough, I encourage you to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkC4zjtAyRc">the talk in full length</a>. If you don&rsquo;t speak french, an english version is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF-bjxB2Nrk&amp;t=217s">here</a>. Finally, slides are also available in <a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz/prise-de-dcisions-asynchrone-devoxx-france-2018">french</a> and <a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz/asynchronous-decision-making-foss-backstage-2017">english</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Even if you don&rsquo;t work remotely, avoiding unnecessary meetings is always a great thing !</p></blockquote>

<h2>Crash course</h2>

<p>For the hasty folks among you, here is a summary. The decision making follows 4 stages :</p>

<ol>
<li>Open discussion and brainstorming. People discuss openly and suggest ideas in a free form manner.</li>
<li>Emergence of options. After enough discussion, a few options will start to make more sense than others.</li>
<li>Coming to a consensus. Someone will draft a formal proposal. People will discuss and amend this proposal until they reach consensus. <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/consensus">Consensus</a> is not <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/unanimous">unanimity</a> !</li>
<li>Decision. After consensus, the benevolent decision owner validates the decision once and for all.</li>
</ol>


<p>Until the decision is taken, the process can move forward but also backward.</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>

<p>We need only two tools to make this possible :</p>

<ol>
<li>For discussion, brainstorming and emergence of options, use a very open and chatty tool. The speaker called this a &ldquo;shared asynchronous communication channel&rdquo;. This can be an online chat, a mailing list or Github issues (<a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-discuss/issues">ex</a>). It could even be a real life whiteboard if you all had access to it.</li>
<li>From drafting the proposal to the end, prefer a structured and chronological tool. The speaker suggests using a &ldquo;shared case management tool&rdquo;. Draft the proposal in this tool, and use comments to log the latest steps of the decision taking. He had examples using Jira issues (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-7231">ex</a>) or Github pull requests (<a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-discuss/pulls">ex</a>). To confirm the decision, close the case. The tool will record which version of the decision was exactly taken.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Architecture Decision Record</h2>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-06-05-how-to-avoid-unnecessary-meetings-a-takeaway-from-devoxx-france-2018/adr.jpg" alt="Drawing of an Architecture Decision Record which work great with asynchronous decision making" /></p>

<p><a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions">ADR</a> is the practice of documenting architecture decisions. It makes sure we remember why we took a decision. This can be very useful to know how to deal with the existing software. A widespread practice for ADRs is to use simple text files in git. There are even <a href="https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools">tools for that</a>. This looks like a perfect fit for decision making using git pull requests ! I&rsquo;ll write a post about that when I get the chance to try.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Git pull requests based asynchronous decision making is a perfect fit for Architecture Decision Records.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Currently experimenting</h2>

<p>I am currently trying this whole decision making technique at work. We are still in the brainstorming phase. We are using our internal chat app for that. Options are starting to emerge, but we did not move to the consensus part yet. I&rsquo;ll write a return on experience post when we reach the end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My current job <a href="http://www.murex.com">at work</a> is technical coach. I&rsquo;m available for teams that need help to adopt incremental coding practices.</p>

<h2>Problems with refactoring legacy code</h2>

<p>A few months ago, a team which was struggling with a lot of legacy code asked for help. As you might know if you read my blog, I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development (TDD)</a> because it has made my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/">life as a developer so much more easy</a>. I&rsquo;m so used to TDD now, that even if I don&rsquo;t have tests yet (as is the case when refactoring legacy code), TDD helps me :</p>

<ul>
<li>To stick to baby steps which are a lot less likely to fail than larges changes.</li>
<li>Write testable code. I know what testable code looks like, and when refactoring, I&rsquo;ll try to change it towards that.</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s why we started to run regular, all team, <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/team-randori-series/">coding dojo randoris</a>. It was nice for the <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/why-you-should-start-a-team-coding-dojo-randori-right-now/">team dynamics</a>, and the people where learning a lot of technical skills. I also got the feedback that they where not able to apply this directly on their day to day job though. After a bit more discussion, I understood that they did not know where this was going, what to expect, and when !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Test Driven Development also teaches you what testable code looks like.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The coding dojo exercices</h2>

<p>It turned out that a coding dojo exercises plan was enough to answer their questions. This is what it looks like.</p>

<p>Here is another, more concrete, version, with sample names of katas we can find online.</p>

<h3>Text</h3>

<p>It starts with simple greenfield katas :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/">Fizz Buzz</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/">Roman Numerals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/">Bowling</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It goes on to intermediate katas, where we can use TDD to do design :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata">Mars Rover</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/PokerHands/">Poker Hands</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/TradingCardGame/">trading card game</a></li>
</ul>


<p>From then on, it&rsquo;s possible to tackle advanced katas and styles :</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactoring fresh code

<ul>
<li>Continue design katas on 2 or more sessions</li>
<li>Always compile Constraint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bottom-up TDD

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/GameOfLife/">Game of Life</a></li>
<li>Median of a list of lists (with no concatenation)</li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/LangtonAnt/">Langton ant</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Top-Down TDD

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Potter/">Kata Potter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/NumberToLCD/">LCD</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TDD on algorithms

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Diamond/">Diamond</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Lags/">Kata Lags</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Anagram/">anagrams</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>All this opens the gate to legacy code refactoring katas :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata">Gilded Rose</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emilybache/Racing-Car-Katas">Race Car Katas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jbrains/trivia">Ugly trivia game</a></li>
<li>Others from <a href="http://kata-log.rocks">http://kata-log.rocks</a></li>
</ul>


<p>At that point, the team can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming">mob</a> to refactor production code :</p>

<ul>
<li>Real life, static analysis issue, mob programming session</li>
<li>Real life, code smell, mob programming session</li>
<li>Real life, larger mob Refactoring</li>
</ul>


<h2>What changed in practice ?</h2>

<p>We wanted to split the teamwork and the coding dojos exercises. The team is now doing mob programming sessions on their usual stories twice a week (I&rsquo;ll blog about that someday). But also doing regular coding dojos exercises in pairs.</p>

<p>Even if they did not go through all the TDD katas yet, mobbing on real stories helps the team to take on legacy code.</p>

<blockquote><p>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. Linus&rsquo;s Law</p></blockquote>

<p>Working in pairs on the code katas allows them to be more engaged in the exercises. In the end, it brings faster learning.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 A mix of Coding Dojos in pairs and Mob Programming sessions is a good way to teach TDD in a Legacy Code context.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the previous 7 articles of <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">this series</a>, I&rsquo;ve tried my best get rid of mocks. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that using these techniques will get you a long way out of <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">mock hell</a>. Excessive mocking leads to unmaintainable tests. Unmaintainable tests lead to low coverage. Low coverage ultimately leads to legacy code. If you haven&rsquo;t already, I encourage you to start reading from <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>One question remains though : Is it realistic to get rid of <em>all</em> mocks ? An even better question would be : Are mocks always bad ? Are there situations when mocking is the best choice ?</p>

<h2>When mocking still makes sense</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s to through a few examples.</p>

<h3>Testing a generic wrapper</h3>

<p>A few years ago, I had to write a service for an enterprise system. As any service, I had to ensure that it was returning nice errors. We decided to capture and wrap all errors from a few &lsquo;gate&rsquo; points in the code. We built a generic wrapper that did only delegation plus exception wrapping. In this case, it made a lot more sense to test this with a mocking framework.</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="err"> </span><span class="c1"># ...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Not only did we reuse the wrapper many times in my service. We also ended up using it in other services as well !</p>

<h3>Injecting a hand written in-memory fake</h3>

<p>As you might have noticed, in <a href="/get-rid-of-mocking-maintenance-with-full-fledged-in-memory-fakes/">the previous article</a>, I recommended to use an in-memory fake instead of mocks. By nature, an in-memory fake is a kind of mock. Even if it is not defined by a mocking framework. (I actually think that by making mocking so easy, mocking frameworks often do more harm than good.)</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 By making mocking so easy, mocking frameworks often do more harm than good.</p></blockquote>

<p>Still, I used <code>const_stub(...)</code> to inject the in-memory fake.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">before</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:each</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="err"> </span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">  </span><span class="n">stub_const</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;TwitterClient::Client&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">FakeTwitterClient</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err"> </span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span> <span class="err"> </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I did this for 2 reasons :</p>

<ul>
<li>Production code can continue to use a straightforward constant</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t risk forgetting to remove the mock at the end of its lifecycle, the framework does this for me</li>
<li>As I&rsquo;m injecting the same fake for all tests, there is not much risk of test conflict (for the moment)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Testing a cache</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;raison d&#8217;être&rdquo; of a cache is to avoid doing something twice. It should also return the same results as if it was not there. This is by nature almost impossible to test with state based assertions. Mock frameworks are great for this situation though. Here is an example :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">context</span> <span class="s2">&quot;UsersController&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err"> </span><span class="n">it</span> <span class="s1">&#39;caches users&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">   </span><span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">User</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">receive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:load</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">once</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">and_return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Joe&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">   </span><span class="n">controller</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">login</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Joe&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;secret&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">   </span><span class="n">controller</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">login</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Joe&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;secret&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err"> </span><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The assertion could not be more explicit, we are checking that the expensive load was only done once.</p>

<h3>Legacy code</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052"><img src="../imgs/2018-06-01-when-is-testing-using-mocks-still-a-good-idea/legacy-code.jpg" alt="Michael C.Feathers explains that testing using mocks is a key practice in &quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> <a href="https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/">Michael Feathers</a> explains how to exploit <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=359417&amp;seqNum=2">&ldquo;seams&rdquo;</a> in the code to put it under test. Mocking is straightforward way to inject behavior through a seam.</p>

<p>Mocking is a pretty good starting point but we need to be careful and keep a few things in mind. Legacy or not, we must not forget that too many mocks will make tests unmaintainable !</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a good idea to refer to a target design or architecture blueprint to know where to inject mocks. (I&rsquo;ll write a post about this one day). This increases the chances to replace them with an in-memory fake later down the road.</li>
<li>Plan to replace the mocks with a better design as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>


<h3>It depends &hellip;</h3>

<p>As with anything in software, there is no absolute rule about mocking. Even if I prefer not to 99% of the time, there are situation when testing using mocks is the thing to do. Knowing the risks, it&rsquo;s up to you to decide !</p>

<h2>If using a mock, prefer spy / proxies</h2>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-06-01-when-is-testing-using-mocks-still-a-good-idea/proxy-plug.jpg" alt="Spies and proxies make testing using mocks less intrusive" /></p>

<p>As I explained in previous posts, mocks duplicate behavior. If we could use mocks without duplicating behavior, they would do less harm.</p>

<p>It turns out there is a flavor of mocks for that : <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">spies</a> and <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/docs/configuring-responses/calling-the-original-implementation">overlooked proxies</a>. Proxies do the real thing but also record the calls and return values. It&rsquo;s as non-intrusive as mocks can be.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Proxy mocks are as unintrusive as mocks can be.</p></blockquote>

<p>For example, here is how our cache test would look like using a proxy :</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more verbose, but simpler. Most mock frameworks provide some form of spy or proxies. A few years ago, I also wrote <a href="http://philou.github.io/rspecproxies">rspecproxies</a>, a wrapper on top of <a href="http://rspec.info/">rspec</a> to make this easier.</p>

Unfortunately, that does not remove all mocks, yet it groups them in the same, less critical, zone. In last week&rsquo;s code sample, this was the controller. I concluded that at least, this was easier to manage. Let&rsquo;s see how.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-05-28-get-rid-of-mocking-maintenance-with-full-fledged-in-memory-fakes/in-memory-fake.jpg" alt="Hand written 'In-memory fake' with memory replaced by a RAM board" /></p>

<p>This is the 7th post in <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">a series about avoiding mocks</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, you might start from <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<h2>Mock concentration</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the <a href="/avoid-mocks-and-test-your-core-domain-faster-with-hexagonal-architecture/">last post</a>&rsquo;s code sample. As a reminder, it&rsquo;s a very basic TODO app built on <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. I extracted the domain part, the tasks, in a core domain area. This allowed to push all mocks out of this section. A consequence though, is that all mocks gathered in the controller test. Here is the controller code :</p>

<p>We need to <a href="https://blog.pragmatists.com/test-doubles-fakes-mocks-and-stubs-1a7491dfa3da">stub out</a> the twitter API for most tests. We are also still using a mock to verify that the tweet is sent. Finally, as we can see from the test execution times, we are still using the database in some tests.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-05-28-get-rid-of-mocking-maintenance-with-full-fledged-in-memory-fakes/test-timings.jpg" alt="Screen capture of the tests execution time" /></p>

<p>If the project grew large this would become an issue. Sadly, mocking is often the fix people jump on &hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Mocking is the unfortunate quick fix to slow tests.</p></blockquote>

<p>From a mocking point of view, our current controller test can seem worse than before ! There&rsquo;s something pretty effective we can do though !</p>

<h2>In memory fakes</h2>

<p>Instead of stubbing and mocking in every test, let&rsquo;s write a full fledged in-memory <a href="https://blog.pragmatists.com/test-doubles-fakes-mocks-and-stubs-1a7491dfa3da">fake</a> that does the job we need. We could then install it once and for all, and forget about it !</p>

<p>Actually, this is nothing new. This is exactly what Rails provides out of the box with <code>ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :test</code>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how we could do the same thing for our Twitter Client.</p>

<p>Simple isn&rsquo;t it ?</p>

<h2>Wait a sec &hellip;</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a catch though &hellip; How do we make sure that this fake is behaving the same way as the real thing ?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s run the same tests on both ! We could mimic the twitter API in our fake, but that might not be a great idea. Do you remember the moto &ldquo;Always wrap your 3rd parties&rdquo; ? It takes all its meaning here, for 2 reasons.</p>

<p>The first is to make faking easier. We can build a minimal wrapper API that is just enough for our use. By keeping this interface small, we&rsquo;ll make it a lot easier to fake.</p>

<p>The second reason is that we can write real integration tests on the 3rd party through this wrapper. They&rsquo;d look like ordinary unit tests, except that they&rsquo;d end up calling the real 3rd party in a sandbox. They are usually pretty slow, but as 3rd parties don&rsquo;t change everyday, that&rsquo;s ok. We can ensure up-front that integration will go well. As a bonus, we can be very fast to detect and contain changes to online services. (I&rsquo;m looking at you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">Scrappers</a>!)</p>

<p>Here is what it would look like for our Twitter client :</p>

<p>As you can see, we renamed <code>update</code> to <code>tweet</code> in the wrapper. We&rsquo;d have to update the calls accordingly. Let&rsquo;s look at the tests.</p>

<p>We had to add a search method to our interface for the sake of testing. This should remain &ldquo;For testing only&rdquo;. We&rsquo;d also adapt the controller test to use this <code>search_tweets</code> method.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at where we stand now. We&rsquo;re injecting each mock only once. Tests are fast yet straightforward, almost as if they were testing the real thing. Doing so, we&rsquo;ve split our system in cohesive parts and we&rsquo;ve wrapped our 3rd parties. We&rsquo;ve actually done a lot more than removing mocks ! <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a">Mocking really is a design smell</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Merciless mock hunting will improve the design of your system !</p></blockquote>

<h2>Last word about implementation</h2>

<p>Sometimes, this 3rd party wrapper can become pretty complicated. Try to reuse as much of it as possible between the real and the fake. For example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a>, like ActiveRecord for example, is a wrapper around the database. Reimplementing a fake ORM would be real challenge. We&rsquo;re far better <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-minutes-hack-to-speed-up-rspec-in-rails-5-using-in-memory-sqlite/">plugin it on top of SQLite</a> instead !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&rsquo;ve written in my last few posts, we can get a long way to avoid mocks with small scale coding best practices. Unfortunately, when systems reach a certain size, we need something at architecture scale.</p>

<p>This is the 6th post of a <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">series about avoiding mocks</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, you can start by <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<h2>Why do we end up with mocks in large systems ?</h2>

<p>A few years ago, I joined a team working in a legacy system. We wanted to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> and refactoring. As expected, adding tests legacy code proved a real challenge. With a lot of effort we could manage to add a few. Unfortunately, this did not seem to have any positive effect on our maintainability ! The tests we were writing all involved a lot of mocking. The system was such a large mass of spaghetti code that there was no clear place to mock. We were actually mocking where it seemed the easiest on a test by test basis. We were making progress at small scale, but the big picture was not improving at all !</p>

<p>Large systems are beasts with many faces. They  involve a lot of IOs. They write and read data from the disk and databases. They call 3rd parties and remote services.</p>

<p>As we test these large systems, we&rsquo;ll need to stub out these IOs. Even if the tests are fast enough, we usually don&rsquo;t want to call external services for real. Most of the time though, tests are slow. That&rsquo;s 2 reasons why end up adding some mocks.</p>

<p>Here comes the nasty part. These large systems are so complex that we, developers, don&rsquo;t have the full picture. When we test, we tend to mock at different places, depending on our knowledge. This is bad for maintenance. Mocks duplicate production code behavior. When many different mocks are in place to isolate an external dependency, we end up with &lsquo;n&rsquo; versions of the code. That&rsquo;s a nightmare to refactor !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 When many different mocks are in place to isolate an external dependency, we end up with &lsquo;n&rsquo; versions of the code !</p></blockquote>

<h2>Hexagonal architecture to the rescue</h2>

<p><a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Alistair Cockburn</a> coined the term. The idea is pretty simple :  isolate a piece of code from all dependencies. This is particularly useful for the core functional areas. With this in place, it becomes straightforward (and fast) to test the core domain logic.</p>

<p>To main techniques to isolate a piece of code from any dependency are :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency injection</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">Adapters</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to split a system in many &lsquo;hexagons&rsquo; and glue them together with adapters at startup. If you want to learn more on this style of architecture, have a look into the <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextmapping">Domain Driven Design lore</a>. This community has been building systems this way for years now.</p>

<h2>Enough talk, show me the code !</h2>

<p>This post was the occasion to try to inject a Hexagonal Architecture and a dash of DDD in a Rails application. There&rsquo;s one caveat though : DDD shines on complex systems. Unfortunately, large and complex systems make very poor didactic examples. The following code highlights the gains about mocking. We would not use DDD for such a small app in real life.</p>

<h3>The starting point</h3>

<p>I chose a simple TODO app. I started by generating a scaffold for a Task with a description and a done/not-done status. As third party interaction, completing a task sends an automatic tweet. Here is the only specific code I wrote on top of the Rails scaffold :</p>

<p>This is pretty simple and to the point !</p>

<h3>5 years later</h3>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s imagine that the app grew to tens of thousands of lines. We added a lot of features to the app, which transformed the TODO domain into a very complex thing. Now suppose that, for the sake of maintenance, we want to isolate the domain logic into its own hexagon. Unlike traditional Rails ActiveRecords, we want to make it independent from the database. We also want it to be independent from the Twitter API.</p>

<p>Here is what the code might look like.</p>

<h6>lib/core/task.rb</h6>

<p>First, we have a core task class, independent from anything else. The Core module is our hexagon.</p>

<p>The main gain here is that our core domain, our most valuable asset is now easy to test without mocks. This means that we are able to write and execute fast tests for this area of the code. This puts us in a great position to increase our competitive advantage in our core business !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 By keeping your tests around your core domain fast, Hexagonal Architecture increases your competitive advantage.</p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, we are now wiring everything together at the controller level. We could later build a facade to isolate the controller from the inside of our domain. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">presenter</a> might do, but it seemed over-engineered, even in this made up example. (I&rsquo;ll post something about that some day)</p>

<h2>Next post</h2>

<p>As we can deduce from the controller code above, we still have to use fakes or mocks when testing the controller. The good thing though is that this is now more local which already makes mocking less of an issue. If a mock is used in less tests, it&rsquo;s easier to use the same mock everywhere ! This is a great opportunity for simplifying test setup, as we&rsquo;ll see in the <a href="/get-rid-of-mocking-maintenance-with-full-fledged-in-memory-fakes/">next post about in-memory fakes</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I cannot write a <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">series about avoiding mocks</a> without mentioning Custom Assertion Matchers. If you don&rsquo;t know what custom assertions are, here is pseudo code that uses a custom assertion :</p>

<p>For more details, have a look at these examples for your preferred language : <a href="http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-custom-assertions.html">Java</a>, <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/custom-matchers">Ruby</a> or <a href="http://tonylukasavage.com/blog/2014/05/29/custom-assertions-in-should-dot-js/">Javascript</a>.</p>

<p>That custom assertion matchers have an effect on mock usage might seem puzzling at first. Let me explain. Us, mere human developers, get lured into mocking when tests become too complicated. By keeping the tests simpler, Custom Assertion Matchers help use to avoid mocks. It&rsquo;s a bit like why test data builders keep mocks at bay.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 We get lured into mocking when tests become too complicated</p></blockquote>

<p>I already blogged about <a href="/speed-up-the-tdd-feedback-loop-with-better-assertion-messages/">the benefits of Custom Assertion Matchers</a>. Here I&rsquo;m going to dive in their advantages against mocking.</p>

<p>This is the fifth post in a <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">series about how to avoid mocks</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, I recommend you to start from <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<h2>Why would we end up with mocks when we don&rsquo;t have matchers ?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walkthrough a small story. Suppose we are building an e-commerce website. When someone passes an order, we want to notify the analytics service. Here is some very simple code for that.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s focus on the tests a bit. We first notice that the verification section is large and difficult to understand.  Looking in more details, it knows too much about the internals of AnalyticsService. We had to make the items accessor public just for the sake of testing. The test even knows how the items are stored in a list of hashes. If we were to refactor this representation, we would have to change the tests as well.</p>

<p>We could argue that responsibility-wise, our test should only focus on Order. It makes sense for the test to use a mock to verify that the Order calls AnalyticsService as expected. Let&rsquo;s see what this would look like.</p>

<p>Sure, the test code is simpler. It&rsquo;s also better according to good design principles. The only glitch is that we now have a mock in place with all the problems I described <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">before</a>.</p>

<p>This might not (yet) be a problem in our example but, for example, the mock &lsquo;cuts&rsquo; the execution of the program. Suppose that someday, the Order starts expecting something from the AnalyticsService. We&rsquo;d then need to &lsquo;simulate&rsquo; the real behavior in our mock. This would make the test very hard to maintain.</p>

<h2>Matchers to the rescue</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how a matcher could help us here. The idea is to improve on the first &lsquo;state checking&rsquo; solution to make it better than the mock one. We&rsquo;ll extract and isolate all the state checking code in a custom matcher. By factorizing the code in a single matcher, we&rsquo;ll reduce duplication. The matcher remains too intimate with the object, but as it is now unique and well named, it&rsquo;s less of a problem. Plus, as always with matchers, we improved readability.</p>

<h2>Design improvements</h2>

<p>Depending on your situation, you might find further design improvements. In our example, a publish-subscribe pattern might do. A better design is likely to fix the encapsulation problem of the matcher. Here again, the custom assertion matchers will help. In most cases, it will be enough to change the implementation of the matchers only.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Custom assertion matchers make refactoring easier by factorizing test assertions.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary of small-scale techniques</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m done with small scale mock avoiding techniques. To summarize, the first thing to do is to push for more and more <a href="/how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/">immutable value objects</a>. Not only does it help us to avoid mocks, but it will also provides many benefits for production code. Practices like <a href="/how-to-use-test-data-builders-to-avoid-mocks-and-keep-your-tests-clear/">Test Data Builders</a> and Custom Assertion Matchers simplify dealing with Immutable Value Objects in tests. They also help to keep tests small and clean, which is also a great thing against mocks.</p>

<h2>Next post</h2>

<p>In the following posts, I&rsquo;ll look into architecture scale techniques to avoid mocks. I&rsquo;ll start with <a href="/avoid-mocks-and-test-your-core-domain-faster-with-hexagonal-architecture/">Hexagonal architecture</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are sometimes tempted to use mocks to shortcut test data initialization. Unfortunately, excessive mocking makes tests difficult to maintain. As <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/05/05/TestDefinitions.html">Uncle Bob explained</a>, it&rsquo;s a road that leads to giving up on tests.</p>

<p>Hopefully, <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builders</a> both shortcut test data setup and avoid mocks.</p>

<p>This is the fourth post <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">of a series about how to avoid mocks</a> in automated tests. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, I recommend you to start from <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<h2>The problem with test data initialization</h2>

<p>Setting up the correct state for automated tests can be pretty verbose. This is especially true for software in complex domains or code with a lot of side effects.</p>

<p>The situation gets worse as tests need to setup similar but not exactly identical data. What I often see in code bases is a lot of test data setup duplication. For example, here are tests for a basic ticketing system.</p>

<p>As you can see, we have less duplication, but the tests got both unreadable and intricate &hellip; Following <a href="/how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/">my advices</a> and using more <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Immutable Value Objects</a> makes the situation worse ! When data is mutable, we can customize it after the call to the Object Mother method. If data is immutable, it all has to be setup at initialization &hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when the mock temptation strikes. Sometimes it&rsquo;s so much easier to mock a method rather than to initialize your data properly. It can be 1 line of mock instead of dealing with all this mess.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 If you are not careful, messy test initialization code will trick you into using mocks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Suppose we now want to make sure we can&rsquo;t add comments that were written before the ticket was created. We&rsquo;ll add the following</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one test (<code>latest change date is time of latest change if after comment</code>) where we were doing just this, will now fail. The fix would be to find a real situation for this test. Here this could be that the ticket is modified after the latest comment. If the tests are too messy though, a mock can be a quick and dirty fix the setup and make the test pass :</p>

<p>There is a third way : Test Data Builders</p>

<h2>What are test data builders</h2>

<p>As often, when design is not satisfying, adding an indirection solves the issue. Here the indirection takes shape of the Builder pattern.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Builder Pattern [</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern"><em>Wikipedia</em></a><em>] :</em></p>

<p>The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so the same construction process can create different representations.</p></blockquote>

<p>The idea is to use the builder pattern to build the test data. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525160355&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests</a> covers this technique in great length.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525160355&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests"><img src="../imgs/2018-05-01-how-to-use-test-data-builders-to-avoid-mocks-and-keep-your-tests-clear/growing.jpg" alt="Cover of the book Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see, it provides default test values, and we only need to provide the custom values we care about. This makes the test code both readable and intention revealing. Making the tests more understandable helps a lot to find ways to avoid mocks. Here, we replaced the mock on the comment time by an update to the ticket after the last comment.</p>

<p>The pattern applies in many languages, even if implementations will be different. In Ruby, libraries like <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot">factory_bot</a> avoid a lot of boilerplate code. Have a look at <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000769.html">this article</a> for examples in Java.</p>

<h2>Other advantages</h2>

<p>Test data builders have another second effect benefit. When setting up the data is complicated, we are likely to add more that one assertion in a test. Unit tests can end up looking like a mini scenario to avoid duplicating this test setup.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to create a specific tests for every assertion with Test Data Builders. By doing so we get smaller and more focused tests, which bring :</p>

<ul>
<li>Better names for tests</li>
<li>More readable tests</li>
<li>Faster diagnostic of the problem when a particular test fails</li>
<li>🎁 Better coverage ! In a large test, all assertions work on the same input values. When we have many small tests, we can use a different value in each.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 By simplifying the creation of new tests with different data, Test Data Builders increase code coverage in the long term!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Next week</h2>

<p>This is the fourth post of <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">a series about how to avoid mocks</a> in automated tests. Next week I&rsquo;ll dig into Custom Assertion Matchers and how they avoid mock expectations.</p>

<h2>Fizz Buzz Example</h2>

<p>As a simple example, I&rsquo;ll go through the classic <a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/">Fizz Buzz</a>. I&rsquo;ve implemented and tested it with and without immutable value objects. Please keep in mind that this is a toy example, where problems are obvious and easily fixed. I try to highlight at small scale the same problems that get hidden by the complexity of a large scale program.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a typical FizzBuzz implementation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are a few problems with this code :</p>

<ul>
<li>With nested logic and complicated mock setup, both code and tests aren&rsquo;t very readable</li>
<li>They both seem to violate the single responsibility principle as well</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s depending on a mutable output. Within a larger program, something could be messing around with this output stream. That would break FizzBuzz.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s now try to use as many immutable values objects as possible, and see what happens to the mocks.</p>

<p>As we can see, using immutable value objects got us rid of the mocks. Obviously, this new code will not be as efficient as the original version, but most of the time, this does not matter. As a bonus though we get finer grain and more readable tests.</p>

<h3>Other testing advantages</h3>

<p>Appart from preventing mocks, Immutable Value Objects have other advantages related to testing.</p>

<ul>
<li>We can directly assert their equality, without having to dig into their guts</li>
<li>We can call methods as many times as we want, without the risk of changing anything and breaking the tests</li>
<li>Immutable Value Objects are a lot less likely to contain invalid state. This removes the need for a whole range of validity tests.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 Immutable Value Objects simplify testing in many ways.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Convincing your teammates</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that Immutable Value Objects have a ton of advantages when testing. People have found that they also have many other benefits :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140528113353-16837833-6-benefits-of-programming-with-immutable-objects-in-java/">6 Benefits of Programming with Immutable Objects in Java</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/5-benefits-of-immutable-objects-worth-considering-for-your-next-project-f98e7e85b6ac">5 Benefits of Immutable Objects Worth Considering for Your Next Project</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Surprisingly though, it&rsquo;s difficult to persuade programmers to use more immutability. It&rsquo;s tricky to explain why returning a modified copy is simpler than just adding a setter.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Why is it so hard to persuade other developers to use immutable data structures ?</p></blockquote>

<p>I had the most success by far when encountering a bug resulting of share mutable state. When this happens, the long term benefits and safety of the immutable design wins people over. The good thing is that as you convince more people in the team, immutability will spread like a virus !</p>

<p>Outside of this situation, you might try some of the following arguments to move people :</p>

<ul>
<li>Immutable values prevent bugs caused by different parts of the system changing the same mutable state</li>
<li>They make it easier to deal with the program in smaller parts and to reason about the system in general</li>
<li>Immutable values don&rsquo;t need any synchronization and make multithreaded programming easier</li>
<li>When tempted to add a simple setter instead of keeping a class immutable, highlight the stressful debugging time to come</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re dealing with a Design By Contract adept, explain how <a href="/almost-15-years-of-using-design-by-contract/">immutability has it built-in</a></li>
<li>Admit that mainstream languages have bad support for Immutable Value. Point to patterns like <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/immutability-with-builder-design-pattern">Data Builders</a> that work around these limitation</li>
</ul>


<h2>Next post</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m done with immutable value objects. It was a far longer post than I thought, but there was a lot to say. This was the third post in a <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">series about avoiding mocks</a>. In <a href="/how-to-use-test-data-builders-to-avoid-mocks-and-keep-your-tests-clear/">next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll dig into another small scale mock fighting pattern : <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builders</a>.</p>
