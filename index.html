  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goose_That_Laid_the_Golden_Eggs">Aesop&rsquo;s famous tale</a>, a farmer kills his goose that lays a golden egg every day to get all the eggs at once. He finds no eggs, lost his goose, and remains poor ever after.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the same pattern happen many times in the software industry. A team decides to become more agile. After a few years of continuous improvement, it shows largely above average performances. Managers start to notice and ask how the team got there, to replicate this success. Unfortunately, they don&rsquo;t want to wait a few years for the other teams to find their own way. As a result, an &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; process is copy printed to all teams. Follows only ephemeral improvement, at the same time that the initial team gets drowned in a company &ldquo;Scaled Agile&rdquo; initiative &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-01-09-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-1-the-situation/lets-all-do-this-agile-thing.jpg" alt="Drawing of a street tag 'Let's all do this Agile thing !&quot;" /></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>In the 60&rsquo;s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Toyota">Toyota</a> was innovating new ways to build cars. Other car manufacturers used to visit the Toyota plants to understand how they did it. Toyota was welcoming them with open arms ! (You can still <a href="http://www.visittoyotaky.com/">visit Toyota plants</a> today) Fortunately for Toyota, none of the visitors managed to copy their results.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Competitors managed to copy Toyota&rsquo;s practices, but not their results !</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s think of other agile companies like Google, Apple or Spotify. Did they copy an existing Agile framework or recipe ? No, they rather learned to embrace change in their own way. The HP LaserJet team did not become more agile by sticking to best practices either, they also did it their own way.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Approach-Large-Scale-Agile-Development/dp/0321821726/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1515476483&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hp+large+scale+agile"><img src="../imgs/2018-01-09-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-1-the-situation/hp-large-scale-agile-dev.jpg" alt="The cover of &quot;A Practical Approach to Large-Scale Agile Development. How HP Transformed LaserJet FutureSmart Firmware&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>Thinking about it, I never read a single story of how a team succeeded by sticking to method X, Y or Z.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just not possible to be agile by strict adherence to a method. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s what most companies do. Have a look at the job posts, everyone is looking for agile devs, but do these companies look agile once you are in ?</p>

<h2>What are the actual results ?</h2>

<p>With a move to &ldquo;Agile&rdquo;, management usually envisions some of the following benefits :</p>

<ul>
<li>better quality</li>
<li>increased productivity through waste reduction</li>
<li>more innovation</li>
</ul>


<p>People who want these changes fast don&rsquo;t understand what they are doing. If they were, they would not expect this to be fast. It&rsquo;s all too easy to see &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; as a method, or a process.</p>

<p>Following the traditional <a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/">&ldquo;machine&rdquo; organization metaphor</a>, processes are to be applied ! Deploying the new &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; process, leaves little room for self-organization and empowerment. People throughout the organization perceive it as yet another reorganization. People still feel like cogs in the machine. Cogs don&rsquo;t show a lot of autonomy and motivation ! That&rsquo;s when the vicious circle kicks in. To fix the lack of drive, management adds more top-down process !</p>

<p>Long story short, these transformations bring very little improvements. At the beginning, when everyone is keeping a close look at the process, things will go a bit better. A few month later, things will get back to where they were.</p>

<blockquote><p><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/JAoAahDozJKWD5?startSlide=13" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/ThoughtWorks/lean-enterprise-how-to-innovate-at-scale" title="Lean Enterprise - Enabling Innovative Culture" target="_blank">Lean Enterprise &ndash; Enabling Innovative Culture</a> </strong> de <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/ThoughtWorks" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a></strong> </div></p></blockquote>

<p>A specific danger of &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; is that it can serve micro-management. Short iterations, code reviews and other feedback practices puts everyone under the radar. This makes decision makers feel more in control, at the cost of motivation and innovation. As an example, check <a href="http://sceptical-meerkat.blogspot.fr/2016/12/pair-programming-whats-in-it-for-me.html">this post</a> from a pair programming sceptic.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; can easily slip into micro-management</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the forth and last post of a <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">series about the #ZeroBugs policy</a>. In the <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/">previous posts</a>, I detailed how we applied it in our team, what were the consequences and how you could do the same.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a catch though, even if you are sure that <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/no_bugs.html">#ZeroBugs</a> is a good thing, people around you might not agree ! As with any kind of change, one of the trickiest thing is overcoming people&rsquo;s fear about your idea. This post will be about dealing with people&rsquo;s resistance.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-4/bug-dilemna.jpg" alt="Drawing of people arguing over the #ZeroBugs policy" /></p>

<h2>A few general change advices</h2>

<p>With time, I discovered general best practices to bring change. The first is that you are much more likely to get your ideas through if you are nice with people ! In a bit more details, this means that :</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to help people, for real !</li>
<li>Listen to their concerns instead of pushing your idea</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t blame people if they don&rsquo;t see the value of your idea</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 Change agent&rsquo;s advice #1 : be nice with people</p></blockquote>

<p>Another invaluable trick is to be patient : change takes time. Finally, if you are stuck, suggest testing your idea for a while, people are more likely to adopt it this way.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enchantment-Changing-Hearts-Minds-Actions-ebook/dp/B004S26HB2/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511346442&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+enchantment"><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-4/enchantment.jpg" alt="Cover of the book &quot;Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds and Actions&quot;" /></a></p>

<h2>Winning the devs over</h2>

<p>Back to our particular #ZeroBugs issue. In this particular case, I would  try to convince the devs first. Reason A is that without them onboard, the practice won&rsquo;t work as well as expected. Reason B is that it is more difficult for management to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to a full team than to a single developer.</p>

<p>Developers will fear spending too much time fixing bugs. Sell them long term fixes instead of dirty quick fixes. Stress that it will be a chance to refactor important, poorly designed parts of the system. Also explain that once the bug backlog is clean, they&rsquo;ll spend more time on new developments.</p>

<p>A last argument for developers is about clarifying prioritization. Pushing bug triage to business people will save devs from feature creep. That should save them from some stress of not delivering.</p>

<h2>Winning business people over</h2>

<p>They&rsquo;ll fear that fixing bugs will reduce the delivery of valuable features. Indeed, if done without care, this is a real danger. Highlight the value of bug fixing : it improves the product and image of the company. Fixing bugs also increases feature delivery in the long run. It does so by removing some recurring support issues and fixing technical debt.</p>

<p>Also point out that they&rsquo;ll have more visibility and control over what is being worked on by the team. This is an opportunity for them to increase the value throughput.</p>

<p>They might also have concerns about the time to spend categorizing bugs. Make sure to get this as streamlined as possible. For example, if they are very busy, you could pre-categorize the issues to make it easier for them.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-we-got-to-zero-bugs-and-implemented-a-zero-bug-policy-c77ee3f2e50b">this blog post</a>, Andrew Fulton explains how he convinced his boss to adopt a #ZeroBugs policy.</p>

<h2>Last words</h2>

<blockquote><p>💡 #ZeroBugs policy makes work more sustainable</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m done with this <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">series about #ZeroBugs policy</a>. I hope I convinced you to give it a try. The developer&rsquo;s life is better without bugs ! If you do, or if you already did, I&rsquo;d love to read about it. Thanks a lot for reading me so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the third post of a <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">series about the #ZeroBugs policy</a>. In the <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/">first 2 posts</a>, I detailed how we applied it in our team, and what were the consequences.</p>

<p>I hope that by now, I have convinced you that applying a <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/no_bugs.html">#ZeroBugs</a> policy is good for you and your team. I&rsquo;ll surprise you by arguing that it&rsquo;s a lot easier than people first think. This post will be about how to inject it in your team.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-3/zero-bug-formula.jpg" alt="A funny formula for zero bugs" /></p>

<h2>Build quality in</h2>

<p>Obviously, you need a low bug rate for this work. If your team creates too many bugs, fixing incoming bugs only will consume all your time. You won&rsquo;t be able to deliver new features and it will make everyone miserable.</p>

<p>If you are in this situation, I&rsquo;d advice you to start investing in coding best practices such as :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.fr/search?q=how+to+start+Continuous+Integration&amp;oq=how+to+start+Continuous+Integration">Continuous Integration</a></li>
<li><a href="/how-to-start-learning-the-tao-of-incremental-code-refactoring-today/">Test Driven Development</a></li>
<li><a href="/how-to-get-your-team-to-do-code-reviews/">Code reviews</a></li>
<li><a href="/from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/">Pair programming</a></li>
<li><a href="/how-to-start-learning-the-tao-of-incremental-code-refactoring-today/">Refactoring</a></li>
</ul>


<p>With grit and time, your bug rate will get down.</p>

<h2>New bugs</h2>

<p>Before dealing with the old bugs, you should first put in place the target policy for new bugs. Don&rsquo;t let the situation get worse !</p>

<p>The way to deal with new bugs is to setup a regular (at least weekly) routine to decide what to do about them :</p>

<ul>
<li>If it&rsquo;s causing real pain to someone and needs a fix as soon as possible, then it&rsquo;s very likely to be a bug</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s something important you can still live without for a few sprints, change it to a story in the backlog.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s not that important now, delete or archive it as &ldquo;won&rsquo;t fix&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>From then on, the new convention is fix all bugs before working on features. This ensures that the bugs backlog will not grow anymore. If you need more details about how to categorize issues, take a look at what <a href="https://medium.com/quality-functions/the-zero-bug-policy-b0bd987be684">Sam Hatoum says about that</a>.</p>

<p>Different people will provide different perspectives on issues. Business people will know their business value. Developers will know fix&rsquo;s impact on technical debt. Finally, service desk people will know how much time they would save with the fix. Depending on your situation, involve the right people in the classification.</p>

<p>Another approach is to do as we did, and come up with clear rules that define what a bug is. This has the advantage of allowing developers to categorize issues on their own. The drawback is that it can be very tricky to come up with these rules.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Agree on rules for categorizing bugs with your users to streamline your flow</p></blockquote>

<h2>Old bugs</h2>

<p>Ok, that was the easy part. How can we deal with the zillions bugs we all have waiting in the backlog ? Depending on the size of your bug backlog, you should adopt different strategies.</p>

<p>If you have a rather small bug debt, as we did, you can get away by prioritizing X bugs every sprint.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose you have a larger bug debt. You could do as <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-we-got-to-zero-bugs-and-implemented-a-zero-bug-policy-c77ee3f2e50b">ConceptShare did</a> and crank out a feature team dedicated to eliminate bugs. That should work, but it will take some time. It took the ConceptShare teams 18 months to get rid of a 350 bugs backlog !</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to take a look at all existing bugs to re-classify some as stories and delete others. Just as you should now be doing with new bugs. This should drastically reduce the number of bugs, but it will take some time from very busy people &hellip; Again, rules to define what a bug is would make this easier.</p>

<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s a last, very effective solution : archive all the bugs ! Some bugs must be months if not years old. Deleting them should not do much harm. Users will report important bugs again anyway. One caveat though : this won&rsquo;t work if your bug rate is too high ! If quality is too low, you&rsquo;ll drawn under old bug.</p>

<h2>Going further</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Explore-Increase-Confidence-Exploratory-Testing/dp/1937785025/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511346285&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=explore+it"><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-3/explore-it.jpg" alt="Cover of the book &quot;Explore It&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to fix the bugs very fast. It&rsquo;s even better if to fix them before the users see them ! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing">Exploratory testing</a> is the way to do that. It will also provide you a measure of how many bugs escape your development process. I encourage you to try this very interesting practice. I wrote <a href="/how-we-started-exploratory-testing/">a guide</a> about how to start exploratory testing.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Exploratory Testing gives you a quantifiable measure of your workflow</p></blockquote>

<h2>Next week</h2>

<p>This was part 3 of a <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">series of posts about the #ZeroBugs policy</a>. In <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-4/">next week&rsquo;s post</a>, I&rsquo;ll provide arguments and advices to convince the people around you to give it a try.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second post of a <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">series about the #ZeroBugs policy</a>. In the <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/">previous post</a>, I detailed what a <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/no_bugs.html">#ZeroBugs</a> policy is and how we tried to apply it. I encourage you start <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/">there</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a quick summary of where we stood. We had tried to apply a #ZeroBugs policy with exploratory testing. We had discovered a lot of bugs, and we had agreed to tackle them little by little. We hoped to finish in a few months.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-2/bug-panic.jpg" alt="The Bug Panic game" /></p>

<h2>The final bug rules</h2>

<p>At about the same time, we started an improvement kata to increase our productivity. I wrote in details about <a href="/how-we-used-the-improvement-kata-to-gain-25-percent-of-productivity-part-1/">the full story</a>, but to make it short, here is what we discovered :</p>

<ul>
<li>It would take us years, not months to fix all our bugs</li>
<li>Our definition for bugs was part of the problem</li>
</ul>


<p>After some experimentation, here is the bug definition we came up with :</p>

<ul>
<li>It corrupts data</li>
<li>It returns wrong results</li>
<li>It crashes with an unexpected error message</li>
</ul>


<p>It stopped scope creep by removing the subjective &ldquo;it used to work&rdquo; rule. This rule also sped up bug fixing a lot. We closed many bugs with descriptive error messages.</p>

<h2>Consequences</h2>

<p>Within 2 sprints, we reached a #ZeroBugs state. Backlog &lsquo;management&rsquo; was simpler as it did not contain bugs anymore. We were also spending less time fixing bugs and more building stories. Even as we resumed our intense exploratory testing sessions, our bug backlog did not grow.</p>

<p>After a while, we discovered other benefits to the #ZeroBugs policy.</p>

<p>Spending less time on bugs made our velocity more stable. Our product owner was happier to see us deliver new features more reliably. In the end, this improved our relationship with him. </p>

<blockquote><p>💡 #ZeroBugs policy makes developers happier</p></blockquote>

<p>It also made the team happier. First, because we had a lot less of stressful emergencies to answer to. Second, because programming new features is more interesting than fixing bugs.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-2/happy-developer.jpg" alt="A relaxed developer" /></p>

<p>It also made the other teams happier and more productive ! They encountered a lot less bugs when using our product. When they had problems, they usually got a clear error message. They would fix it on their side, or suggest us a new feature.</p>

<p>A #ZeroBugs policy and exploratory testing also have a side effect on technical debt ! Bugs tend to appear in the more brittle parts of the code. When fixing bugs, you took the opportunity to refactor technical debt at the same time.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 #ZeroBugs policy reduces technical debt</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, having a definition for bugs was very helpful. It allowed decentralized prioritization of bugs. The alternative to that is to have a domain expert available to sort bugs from stories. A decentralized rule prevents all sort of coordination and people issues. Our system was rather technical, which made it easy to define what a bug is. In other cases, it might be worth spending some time with the domain expert to define similar rules.</p>

<p>To summarize, sticking to #ZeroBugs is a win-win and sustainable situation for all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some teams spend 95% of their development time fixing bugs &hellip; An entrepreneur I worked with reported an even scarier story. He went bankrupt because bugs were taking <em>all</em> the development time. He had no time left for new features !</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, some <a href="http://leanagilepartners.com/library/Vanschooenderwoert-EmbeddedNumbers.pdf">eXtreme Programming teams</a> reported bug rates as low as 1.5 per month !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Some XP teams reported bug rates as low as 1.5 per month !</p></blockquote>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great for everyone if we had less bugs to fix ? Programmers would do more interesting work. Business people would get more valuable features. People would do less overtime. All this while users get a better product !</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/aim-bug.jpg" alt="A bug in a viewfinder" /></p>

<p>Last year, in my team, we reached and maintained a #ZeroBugs state. Here is how we did it.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/no_bugs.html">#ZeroBugs</a> policy</h2>

<p>Before we jump into our story, let&rsquo;s take a second to understand what this is all about.</p>

<p>Bugs waste time. They waste the time of users, who can&rsquo;t do what they need. They waste everyone&rsquo;s time with interruptions from unhappy user. They steal time from new features development. If you have a large number of known bugs, you&rsquo;ll also waste some time organizing them : eliminating duplicates, prioritizing them, ignoring others &hellip;</p>

<p>A #ZeroBugs policy is the convention of having no bugs in your backlog. This means that when someone finds a defect, it should be immediately :</p>

<ul>
<li>fixed before any other feature</li>
<li>prioritized as a new story</li>
<li>or ignored (for the moment)</li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously, the less bug you create the easier this will be.</p>

<h2>Our journey to a #ZeroBugs policy</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>We were an R&amp;D team, building a data management system. Our product was moving outside of pure research and development. Other teams were starting to use it and often reported bugs back to us.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d first read about #ZeroBugs in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-Pragmatic-Software/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511342870&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile">The Art of Agile Software Development</a>. Given enough automated testing, XP teams could almost stop doing bug fixing !</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-Pragmatic-Software/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511342870&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile"><img src="../imgs/2017-11-22-why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-1/art-of-agile.jpg" alt="Cover of the book &quot;The Art of Agile Software Development&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>As we had very solid automated testing in place, we decided to take the extra steps to save time on bug fixing.</p>

<h3>First attempt</h3>

<p>There is a straightforward way to install a #ZeroBugs policy. Make sure to have a customer or a Product Owner to prioritize defects as soon as they appear (check <a href="https://medium.com/quality-functions/the-zero-bug-policy-b0bd987be684">this story</a> for an example).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this would not work for us. Our Product Owner was great at providing us with a long term vision. He could not be available for day to day bug prioritization though.</p>

<p>Our first try was to propose a definition for bugs that we could use ourselves to classify them. We decided that something was a bug if either of the following was true :</p>

<ul>
<li>It corrupts data.</li>
<li>It returns wrong results. As we were building a data management system, this was rather easy to verify.</li>
<li>It used to work but is now broken</li>
</ul>


<p>Whenever we found an issue meeting any of these points, we would start working on it straightaway.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Exploratory testing goes hand in hand with #ZeroBugs policy</p></blockquote>

<p>To speed up downstream integration of our product by other teams, we also <a href="/how-we-started-exploratory-testing/">started Exploratory Testing</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing">Exploratory testing</a> is a practice that goes hand in hand with a #ZeroBugs policy.</p>

<h3>Unearthing a bug debt</h3>

<p>During the first exploratory testing session, we found more than 10 bugs. We thought that with a bit of focus we could fix all lingering bugs in a few weeks max &hellip; After 2 other sessions and more than one sprint of intense bug fixing, we had even unearthed more bugs. We were wrong, this would take a lot more than a few weeks.</p>

<p>If we kept on our 1 hour exploratory testing sessions every sprint, we would fill our backlog with bugs. We would also be fixing bugs for a few months before we could tackle any new feature !</p>

<p>We agreed on the following strategy to fix all these bugs little by little :</p>

<ul>
<li>stop these intense exploratory testing sessions</li>
<li>do shorter exploratory testing sessions at the end of every story</li>
<li>fix 5 to 6 bugs every sprint</li>
</ul>


<p>We hoped to fix all our bugs in a few months.</p>

<h2>Next week</h2>

<p>That was the first part of <a href="/blog/categories/zero-bugs-series/">a series of posts about #ZeroBugs policy</a>. In the <a href="/why-and-how-to-start-a-number-zerobugs-policy-part-2/">next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll explain how we dealt with this bug debt and dig into the consequences it had on our work.</p>

<h2>The best jam is made in old jars</h2>

<p>As I was writing the post, I could not stop thinking :</p>

<blockquote><p>Once again, XP has been addressing these WIP and prioritization issues for 20 years now !</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see exactly how.</p>

<h3>WIP limitation</h3>

<p>XP has a drastic way to reduce WIP by 2 : pair programming. Instead of 6 developers taking on 6 stories at the same time, they only tackle 3. I won&rsquo;t dive into the ton of other advantages to pair programming here. If you want to learn more, these <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/pair-programming/">blog posts</a> might help.</p>

<p>Although it is now seen as a Scrum practice, Planning Game was part of original XP. Sticking to a basic planning game will give room for slack at the end of iterations. The trick is to leave the <a href="https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2">infamous focus factor</a> away.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 A simple planning game will give room for slack.</p></blockquote>

<p>Suppose a team member takes vacations for a sprint. The team should deliver less user stories that sprint. They&rsquo;ll have less story points to schedule on next sprint. This leaves room for slack and long term improvements such as refactoring, learning &hellip; If half the team goes on holiday, that&rsquo;s a different story, adapt your schedule with gut feeling.</p>

<p>A funny aspect of this is that XP teams are now the most likely to switch to the more extreme <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates">#NoEstimates</a>.</p>

<h3>Priorities</h3>

<p>XP&rsquo;s on-site customer is a straightforward way to work only on the most valuable features. Who better than an end user would be able to make this estimation ?</p>

<p>The YAGNI (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">You Ain&rsquo;t Gonna Need It</a>) and simple design principles avoid building unnecessary features. TDD&rsquo;s strict point of not writing code before a failing test prevents over-engineering.</p>

<h2>Modern XP</h2>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/221024846" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>In this wonderful talk from <a href="http://rachelcdavies.github.io/">Rachel C. Davies</a>, she presents how her team has been improving XP for 15 years. She explains how they organize as 2 mobs and 1 solo. At any moment, one mob is working on stories. The other mob works on important long term technical improvements. The solo does some learning. This is an even greater WIP reduction technique than pair programming.</p>

<p>Having a dev doing learning all the time is a form of continuous slack. If the team feels that they cannot deliver something by an important date, he can join the mob to help them.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s even more to this learning. It can be about anything. Developers work on their technical skills, but they also learn about the domain. Little by little this turns them into domain experts. Guess what : domain experts are great at optimizing value !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 With time and efforts, developers can become domain experts !</p></blockquote>

<h2>Afterthoughts</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to prove the long term productivity of XP. We cannot split the world to run the same project with and without XP. Another difficulty is that after a years of XP, work remains smooth and sustainable. Nothing like crunch mode. People used to the hero culture are hard to convince that they can be more productive by doing less.</p>

<p>Hopefully, lean theory and gut feeling of programmers who have switched to XP can back up my claims.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the last 15 years, I&rsquo;ve worked in many different teams. Every team has its own way of working. I&rsquo;ve been at places where everyone seemed busy all the time. Did we deliver more ? No. Often quite the opposite ! The most productive teams I&rsquo;ve been in used to do no more than 6 hours of solid work every day &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-20-are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/dev-in-mouse-wheel.jpg" alt="A developer in a mouse wheel" /></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the reason behind that ?</h2>

<p>In Lean Management theory, lead time is the time it takes to get a feature from customer request to delivery. Here is a graph that draws typical lead time over factory load (1 &ndash; idle time percentage).</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-20-are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/cycle-time-vs-utilization.jpg" alt="A graph of the lead time versus utilization" /></p>

<p>What does all this tell us ? </p>

<p>When utilization becomes too high, people start multitasking. As multitasking increases, productivity drops, delaying projects. As a consequence, products are late to hit the market. On the other side, a low utilization means paying people to be idle. That might put any company out of business. Factory managers&#8217; best practice is to limit Work In Progress by loading their assembly lines around 80%. Not too high to avoid over-utilization, but not too low to avoid wasting time.</p>

<p>Every software product is new product development (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Iterative-Development-Managers-Guide/dp/0131111558/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509112918&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=larman+a+manager%27s+guide">Craig Larman</a>). As such, they are way less predictable than any assembly line. It means we need more slack to absorb unexpected variations (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation-ebook/dp/B007TKU0O0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509112980&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=reinertsen+flow">Donald G. Reinertsen</a>). This tells us that we should have more than 20% of slack in our schedules and plannings. Unfortunately, overloading and multitasking is a wide spread disease in the software world.</p>

<h2>How to get rid of task switching ?</h2>

<p>The answer is obvious : prioritization ! Only work on the most important item at a time. It&rsquo;s not because we start everything now that they&rsquo;ll sell them earlier ! It&rsquo;s quite the opposite in fact !</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-20-are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/concurrent-vs-sequential.jpg" alt="A comparision of sequential and concurrent product development" /></p>

<p>Here is another advantage to prioritization. It decreases the time between start and completion of a feature. This, in turn, decreases the likelihood of building something obsolete.</p>

<p>One last thing about prioritization &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-20-are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/Cost-of-Delay-distribution.png" alt="A graph of values of features in decreasing order" /><div class="image-credits"><a href="http://blackswanfarming.com/experience-report-maersk-line/">&ldquo;Black Swan Farming Using Cost of Delay&rdquo;</a> Joshua J.Arnold and Özlem Yüce</div></p>

<p>This graph tells us that a small fraction of the features bring most of the value, while a very large portion of the features bring almost no value &hellip; As puzzling as this graph may be, it&rsquo;s also a wonderful opportunity. If we manage to focus one the most valuable features only, we can save a ton of work, while being more effective ! <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean startup</a> and market research are techniques to identify these features up-front.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 You don&rsquo;t need more time, you just need to decide ! Seth Godin</p></blockquote>

<h2>Culture issue</h2>

<p>Becoming more effective by banning overtime, enforcing monotasking and being serious about prioritizing ? These ideas are heresy in some workplaces ! Have a look around you. Are people overworked ? Are they fire fighting all the time ? Are they drowning in multitasking ? If it&rsquo;s the case, I bet there&rsquo;s a wide scale lack of prioritization issue at your workplace.</p>

<p>People at the top of the company need to control the overall WIP. If they don&rsquo;t, multitasking will catch you up, however you try to escape it. Multitasking can be obvious e.g., when we need to work on different projects at the same time. It can also sneak in as maintenance, or unrelated meetings marathons. Another symptom is when developers need to take on &ldquo;submarine&rdquo; refactoring initiatives. From experience, that&rsquo;s often the case in sales driven companies. Where any customer request is agreed and sold, regardless of the company&rsquo;s capacity.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Require​ ​everyone​ ​in​ ​product​ ​and​ ​engineering​ ​to​ ​read​ ​​Principles​ ​of​ ​Product​ ​Development​ ​Flow by Donald Reinertsen. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-do-we-go-faster-ed51207952a8">John Cutler</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting parallel in the Stephen R. Covey&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/7-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0935721800/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509113465&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=7+habits+of">7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>. He says we should drop the urgent and not important for the important and not urgent. In software term, it means spending time on important and long term work rather than short term stuff. We should do more refactoring, hiring, training and continuous improvement. We should stoping building features we are not sure of the value.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s summarize. Here are my advices to work less and be more productive. Enforce hard WIP limits at all levels. Do serious prioritization. Provide enough slack. In my <a href="/sustainable-productivity-in-extreme-programming/">next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll show how XP addresses these issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/distributed-teams-remote-collaboration">Far From the mobbing crowd</a> the <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a> guys explain how they combined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming">mob programming</a> and remote work. <a href="https://twitter.com/mattwynne?lang=fr">Matt</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tooky?lang=fr">Steve</a> also explain that a mob is both resilient and fast. They explain that they sometimes have to leave the mob for 15 minutes or so. When they come back the code has changed a lot ! It&rsquo;s as if the mob continues no matter who&rsquo;s in.</p>

<p>One of them then suggests an idea. </p>

<blockquote><p>With enough people around the world, we could run a mob that never stops!</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-12-mobbing-around-the-world-for-48h-dot-dot-dot-whos-in/mob-drawing.jpg" alt="A drawing of a mob walking around a binary world" /></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the point ?</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/">The Ultimate Guide To Remote Work</a> the <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> team explains how to take advantage of time zones and remote work. We can get a feature done faster by having a pair of programmers from different time zones work on it ! Instead of a single day of work in 24h, you get 2 ! We could get features in half the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/"><img src="../imgs/2017-10-12-mobbing-around-the-world-for-48h-dot-dot-dot-whos-in/ultimate-guide-remote-work.png" alt="The cover of The Ultimate Guide To Remote Work" /></a></p>

<p>In Lean Management, the time to get a feature is called the cycle time. A short cycle time has a lot of benefits. You get feedback faster. The needs of the users have less risk of changing. You&rsquo;ll get less interruptions, which increases your focus and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Zapier found that time zones and remote work can divide the cycle time by 2. This is already a major improvement. Let&rsquo;s replace this pair of programmers by a mob ! The cucumber guys explain that 4 hours of mobbing is about the most someone can do in a single day. With a mob of 5 people at any time, that&rsquo;s around :</p>

<p><em>24/4 * 5 = 30</em></p>

<p>30 developers working on the same feature, full time !</p>

<p>What would be the effect of this on cycle time ? I don&rsquo;t expect it to cut the cycle time by 30, but from my experience with pairing, I&rsquo;d still expect a drastic reduction. Imagine a complex feature that you estimated to 30 days to finish. Could it be done in less than a week ?</p>

<p>Working on a single story at a time, we could forget merges and complex CIs ! More generally, it would lead to an important Work In Progress (WIP) reduction. Very related to cycle time, reducing the WIP also brings a lot of improvements. One of the most important is an increased throughput. <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/deliver-software-faster-by-managing-work-in-progress-not-by-adding-overtime">Here</a> is a great article detailing the benefits of reducing the WIP.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Mob programming reduces WIP and cycle time</p></blockquote>

<p>And what about the team structure ? Could a team of 30 be effective in this setting ? 7 is the magic count for a team size. If we could grow past this number, we could imagine completely new org charts :</p>

<ul>
<li>More decentralized</li>
<li>More resilient </li>
<li>Less synchronization and coordination overhead</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/distributed-teams-remote-collaboration"><img src="../imgs/2017-10-12-mobbing-around-the-world-for-48h-dot-dot-dot-whos-in/far-from-mobbing-crowd.jpg" alt="A screen capture of 'Far from the mobbing crowd'" /></a></p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s try it !</h2>

<p>As any new idea, it&rsquo;s also very likely to fail miserably &hellip; The communication overhead could turn out overwhelming. The mob might not be resilient to frequent changes after all. It could work but not bring any reduction to cycle time. There is a ton of reasons for this to fail.</p>

<p>The best way to find out is to try !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Stupid ideas that work become great ideas. [<a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/tricks/pick-something-stupid/">XP moto</a>]</p></blockquote>

<p>We just need to find enough people spread around the world to give it a try. Could we do 48 hours straight of mobbing and go twice around the globe ?</p>

<p>We would need people distributed across all time zones. Pairing and incremental design would be de-facto practices. It would work better with people used to XP.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d need at least a mob of 3 doing 5h of mobbing per day for 2 days. That would be :</p>

<p><em>24/5*3 = 15</em></p>

<p>We could go with 15 people but 30 would be ideal. Once we have enough volunteers, we&rsquo;ll have to agree on a few other things :</p>

<ul>
<li>A date for the experiment</li>
<li>A subject we can all understand</li>
<li>Technologies and tools to use</li>
<li>A time-schedule</li>
</ul>


<p>There&rsquo;s nothing impossible here !</p>

<p><a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>, the creator of Rails, is a cult in the Ruby community. You can find the history of Rails at many places. If you have a bit of time, read <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/02/mf-signals/?currentPage=all">this great article</a> from Wired. If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of time, here is a summary.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried?lang=fr">Jason Fried</a> and DHH were working at <a href="https://37signals.com/">37signals</a>. They were working on project management app for small businesses called <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. After releasing the first version of Basecamp, DHH extracted and open sourced Rails out of it.</p>

<p>37signals later then re-used Rails to build other apps like Campfire, Highrise and Backpack.</p>

<p>We all know the end of the story, Rails adoption exploded. Many successful companies like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> have used it. It evolved a lot, through the darwinism of open source. Today, Rails might not be the latest and coolest web framework, but it is still very productive and popular.</p>

<h2>Economic sense</h2>

<p>To summarize, here is how they did it :</p>

<ol>
<li>Built a specific app, and monetized it</li>
<li>Extracted an open source framework from it</li>
<li>Built other apps on the framework</li>
</ol>


<p>If you are not a programmers, you&rsquo;re likely to assume that the cost of reusing software is negligible. If you are a programmer, I&rsquo;ll ask you to assume that it is for a while.  Under this hypothesis, all they did makes a lot of business sense :</p>

<ul>
<li>Building a specific app first is the fastest path to paying customers. Building a framework first would need more work.</li>
<li>Once you have paying customers, you&rsquo;ve got money to fuel further work.</li>
<li>In particular, you have money to finance the extraction of an open source framework.</li>
<li>Putting the framework open source increases its reusability through bug reports and contributions.</li>
<li>Building the next app is even easier thanks to a mature framework and the revenues from the original app</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 Once you have paying customers, you&rsquo;ve got money to fuel further work.</p></blockquote>

<h2>How can it work ?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507610064&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rework"><img src="../imgs/2017-10-09-what-rails-teaches-us-about-building-platforms-and-frameworks/rework-cover.jpg" alt="Cover of Rework book" /></a></p>

<p>Ok, enough for common sense. Let&rsquo;s see what happens when you take into account the real cost of changing software ? All software developers know that changing software is far from cheap. Very often, it&rsquo;s more expensive to adapt than to rebuild</p>

<p>So how did the Rails guys manage it ? Rails has 3 specificities that explain that :</p>

<ul>
<li>Rails has automated testing built in and out</li>
<li>Basecamp guys are agile with a lower &lsquo;a&rsquo;. They don&rsquo;t follow Scrum or any method. Read <a href="https://basecamp.com/about/books">their books</a> and you&rsquo;ll understand how agile they are. They follow principles like KISS, YAGNI, Lean startup discovery &hellip;</li>
<li>Finally, it was open sourced !</li>
</ul>


<p>Agile principles and technical practices is what allowed them to take the common-sense path.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Thanks to agile practices, the cheapest way to build a framework is to extract it from a specific app.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Open question</h2>

<p>If it is possible to do the thing that makes the most economic sense, why isn&rsquo;t it the default way ? Why are so many of us still losing a ton of money writing large frameworks and platforms up-front ? How could we get large companies to adopt the more nimble &lsquo;basecamp&rsquo; way ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/The_Improvement_Kata.html">improvement kata</a> can solve problems that typical retrospectives fail to address. Although there is a halo of mystery around it, it&rsquo;s actually not that difficult to get started ! Here is a guide.</p>

<p>During the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been blogging about the improvement kata. You can read <a href="/how-we-used-the-improvement-kata-to-gain-25-percent-of-productivity-part-1/">the full story</a> of the first time we applied it in our team to gain 25% of productivity. If you are more interested by what it taught us, check this <a href="/lessons-learned-from-running-our-first-improvement-kata/">other post</a>.</p>

<h2>A 5 bullets summary</h2>

<p>Here is how I would explain what the improvement kata is :</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a continuous improvement technique. It relies on the scientific method to reach a target state.</li>
<li>It involves running experiments to know if your ideas are valid.</li>
<li>It can be long to run through, but it works on tricky situation where retrospectives don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s 100% scientific. It uses data analysis and deduction. Not gut feeling and community best practices.</li>
<li>It can be part of the backlog, as any other item. It does not have to be a special event like retrospectives usually are.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>💡 The improvement kata is 100% scientific, it uses data and deduction, not gut feeling and best practices</p></blockquote>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s give it a try ! </h2>

<p>Is that enough for you to give it a try ? If so, great, read on ! If you need a bit more convincing, check the <a href="/how-we-used-the-improvement-kata-to-gain-25-percent-of-productivity-part-1/">full story</a> of how we gained 25% of productivity with it.</p>

<p>Here is how to get started :</p>

<ol>
<li>The first thing is to read about it. If you have the time, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Kata-Managing-Improvement-Adaptiveness/dp/0071635238/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507005860&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=toyota+kata">Toyota Kata</a> is a good read. If you read French, the <a href="http://leanagilecamp.fr/index.html">&ldquo;Petit guide de management lean à l&#8217;usage des équipes agiles&rdquo;</a> is a very pleasant and easy read. Finally if you want to cut it as short as possible, read the <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/Homepage.html">Toyota Kata website</a>.</li>
<li>Pick a topic to try it on. Best candidates are clear and important problems. They might have emerged out of a retrospective for example. The scope should be small enough not to get lost.</li>
<li>Once you&rsquo;ve identified a topic, someone or a pair should take ownership of the kata. It&rsquo;s very unlikely that you&rsquo;ll be able to do the full kata in one afternoon. Understanding happens when the brain is at rest, and experiments take time. The owners need to dedicate some time to follow up on the kata.</li>
<li><p>Repeatedly ask yourself the <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/The_Coaching_Kata.html">coaching kata</a> questions. This will help you and your pair to stay on track.</p>

<ol>
<li>What&rsquo;s the target condition ? (Describe what are you trying to achieve)</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the actual condition ? (Describe your current situation)</li>
<li>What obstacles do you think are preventing you from reaching the target condition ? Which one are you addressing now ? (Describe the first problem you are about to try to fix)</li>
<li>What is your next step ? What do you expect ? (Describe the experiment you are going to run to test a solution)</li>
<li>When can we go and see what we have learned from taking that step ? (Run the experiment and learn from the results. Decide on a process change or repeat from an earlier step)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Going through the kata in pair is a great way to spread the practice within the team. At some point you might be able to run many improvement katas in parallel ! Just make sure not to walk on each other&rsquo;s toes &hellip;</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Expect the first time to be a bit rocky, and to feel lost from time to time &hellip;</p>

<h2>Start today !</h2>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-03-how-to-run-your-first-improvement-kata/rocket-launch.jpg" alt="The main steps of the improvement kata" /></p>

<p>Many practices and techniques seem daunting at first. Remember the first time you wrote a test before the code. The first time you tried to program using only immutable data structures. Or the time you wrote your first &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; program !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 We can learn anything on our own by just doing it</p></blockquote>

<p>The improvement kata is no different. Give it a go, and you&rsquo;ll learn a powerful technique.</p>

<p><em>Whether you have already used the kata, you plan to use it or you have questions about it, I&rsquo;d like to hear from you ! Leave a comment.</em></p>
