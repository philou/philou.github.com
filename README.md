### To avoid "No GitHub API authentication" error

The solution is [here](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/399)
As suggested, I ended up creating a github token and putting it in _preview.sh :

```bash
#!/bin/sh

export JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN=XXX
./_update_version.sh
./_serve.sh
```

A token with only repo-read and notifications accesses seem to fix the issue.
