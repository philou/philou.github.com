## Hacks made to Minimal Mistakes

These are hacks I've made to the Minimal Mistakes, that I'll try to push to the main repo.

### Reddit and HN buttons

I replaced the Facebook by HN and Reddit share buttons. I more or less followed the guide from [Minimal Mistake Layout doc](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/). I could not find the $social list to update, so I used inline styles on the buttons to get the correct colors.

It would be better to add Reddit and HN buttons to buttons.scss
