    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I eventually stumbled upon a way to keep track of technical debt in source code that is both straightforward and already built-in most tools : simple <code>TODO</code> comments !</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-04-12-a-seamless-way-to-keep-track-of-technical-debt-in-your-source-code/todo-comment.jpg" alt="Photo of a screen displaying source code with #TODO comments" /></p>

<h2>How it happened ?</h2>

<p>Some time ago, we tried to add <a href="/a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/"><code>@TechnicalDebt</code></a> annotations in our source code. Unfortunately, after a few month, we came to the logical conclusion that it was too complex to be effective :</p>

<ul>
<li>It involved too much ceremony, which frightened people</li>
<li>It made people uneasy to change anything around the annotation instead of sending a call to action</li>
<li>As a result, it was always out of date</li>
</ul>


<p>After a bit of discussion with my colleagues, we decided to replace all these annotations with simple <code>TODO</code> comments.</p>

<p>When the refactoring to do seems fairly obvious (but also premature) we&rsquo;ll use a straightforward <code>//TODO (example) introduce a factory</code> message. Next time a pairs gets to work on this part of the code, they get the silent opinion of their peers to help them decide what to do about this piece of the code. Other times, the code might be smelly, yet without us knowing what to do about it yet, in this case, we agreed to use <code>//TODO SMELL (example) responsibilities are not clear in this class</code> which is still a <code>TODO</code> comment, but not a clear call to action.</p>

<p>When I started my <a href="https://github.com/philou/planning-poker">current side project</a>, I naturally started to use them. They display nicely in <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/philou/planning-poker/issues">CodeClimate</a>.</p>

<h3>The pros</h3>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-04-12-a-seamless-way-to-keep-track-of-technical-debt-in-your-source-code/codeclimate.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the CodeClimate issue dashboard displaying TODO comments" /></p>

<p>The great thing about <code>TODO</code> comments is that, as a very old programming trick, they are already supported out of the box by most tools <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">IntelliJ</a>, <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, <a href="https://codeclimate.com">CodeClimate</a> and I guess many others. Only one day after I refactored to <code>TODO</code> comments, a team mate fixed one that had appeared in his IDE&rsquo;s TODO tab !</p>

<h3>The cons</h3>

<p>Some tools, IDEs in particular, tend to assume that you should fix all your <code>TODOs</code> before you commit anything. That&rsquo;s not exactly how we are using them to track lasting technical debt. So that&rsquo;s one thing you need to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Tools like Sonar on the other hand, assign a fixed remediation cost to any <code>TODO</code> you have in the code, which is usually not the case at all !</p>

<h2>How to set it up in your project</h2>

<p>As you might guess, this is pretty easy. Just start adding <code>TODO</code> comments in your code &hellip;</p>

<h3>Teamwise</h3>

<p>It is worth first validating the practice with your colleagues though. There are many ways to do that, depending on your team&rsquo;s work habits :</p>

<ul>
<li>Use your team <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> (or whatever chat room you use) to share a link to this post (for example) and create a yes/no poll</li>
<li>Or if you think you need it, create some wiki page explaining the practice and detailing its rationals in your context, add a yes/no poll, and finally share this page with your team</li>
<li>Eventually, if you think that this topic deserves it, setup a meeting with everyone and discuss the point. It might be worth sharing information about the practice beforehand to make the meeting more efficient. You can end the vote with a <a href="http://www.plays-in-business.com/thumb-voting/">thumb vote</a> (up : yes, down : no, side : whatever)</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="../imgs/2017-04-12-a-seamless-way-to-keep-track-of-technical-debt-in-your-source-code/thumb-vote.jpg" alt="Thumbs voting positions" /><div class="image-credits">Photo from <a href="http://www.plays-in-business.com/thumb-voting/">Plays in Business</a></div></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t wait for unanimity to start the practice, majority is enough ! Make sure that people who voted the other way will follow the team practice in the end though. Remember that whatever the answer, discussing team practices is good.</p>

<p>Once all the team agreed on using (or not) <code>TODO</code> comments, mention the practice in your team&rsquo;s coding conventions or working agreements (which I strongly recommend to have written somewhere). If you don&rsquo;t have any yet, create some !</p>

<h3>Toolswise</h3>

<p>Most tools will handle <code>TODO</code> out of the box.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rails comes with a <code>rake notes</code> task to list <code>TODO</code> comments.</li>
<li>CodeClimate and SonarQube both lists <code>TODOs</code> as issues in their default config</li>
<li>Most IDEs have a &lsquo;TODO&rsquo; tab which will display the <code>TODO</code> comments in the project</li>
<li>Otherwise, good old grep will very happily find <code>TODO</code> comments in your code</li>
</ul>


<p>Some tools might require small tweaks to improve the experience :</p>

<ul>
<li>In IntelliJ, in the commit window, uncheck the &lsquo;Check TODO&rsquo; checkbox to avoid getting a warning at every commit</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="../imgs/2017-04-12-a-seamless-way-to-keep-track-of-technical-debt-in-your-source-code/intellij-commit.jpg" alt="IntelliJ's commit window, with its 'Check TODO' check box" /></p>

<ul>
<li>SonarQube uses the same fixed remediation cost for every TODO comment. It&rsquo;s up to you to adapt this remediation cost to your context.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What&rsquo;s next ?</h2>

<p><code>TODO</code> comments are a good starting point to track technical debt. Once you start using them, there are a few things you can do :</p>

<p>First, remember to fix some regularly. Very old <code>TODO</code> comments are technical debt of their own ! Using code quality dashboards like SonarQube or CodeClimate help to continuously improve your code.</p>

<p>If your tools allow it, you might consider setting up a simpler <code>//SMELL ...</code> instead of <code>//TODO SMELL ...</code> or whatever other special comment that might be useful in your context.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a lean continuous improvement practice which consists of logging problems as they occur. Doing this could help your team to decide which technical debt hotspots are the most important to fix. When appropriate, link the problems with the <code>TODO</code> comments. After a few weeks of this, walking through all the problems during a retrospective should shed light on what parts of the code are causing the most troubles.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/almost-15-years-of-using-design-by-contract/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-14T18:57:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/almost-15-years-of-using-design-by-contract</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I first read about Design By Contract in 2002, in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Book-CD-ROM/dp/0136291554/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490073815&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=object+oriented+software+construction+meyer">Object Oriented Software Construction 2</a>. As soon as I read it, I was convinced, today, I still believe it&rsquo;s a great and fundamental technique. That&rsquo;s why, I almost never write a contract ! Let me explain.</p>

<h2>Phase 1 : DbC ignorance</h2>

<p>I started to code professionally in 2001. This was a time where design and quality software meant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Rose_XDE">Rational Rose</a> (a UML design and code generation tool) while I, at the contrary, was just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding">Cow Boy Coding</a> my way out of any problem I was given.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really doing Object Oriented programming, but rather imperative programming, using objects as structs, getters, setters, and classes as a way to organize the code &hellip; In this context, my design skills were improving slowly, and I was at the risk of falling in love with a local-optimum practice that would prevent me from growing further.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I started to read books such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490074343&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=design+patterns">Gang Of Four Design Patterns</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Book-CD-ROM/dp/0136291554/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490073815&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=object+oriented+software+construction+meyer">OOSC2</a>.</p>

<h2>Phase 2 : DbC enlightenment</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Book-CD-ROM/dp/0136291554/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490073815&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=object+oriented+software+construction+meyer"><img src="../imgs/2017-03-14-almost-15-years-of-using-design-by-contract/OOSC2.jpg" alt="The cover of the Object Oriented Software Construction 2" /></a></p>

<p>Reading this book was a profound experience to me. My programming changed fundamentally before and after reading it. The chapter about contracts, taught me what objects are.</p>

<p>One the one hand, Pre and Post conditions can be used in any kind of programming and are just a kind of C <code>assert</code> macro on steroids. Class invariant, on the other hand, is a completely different kind of beast. The invariant of a class is a predicate about an instance of this class that should always be true. For example : field X should never be null, or the value of field N should always be greater than 0.</p>

<p>In some way, grasping the concept of invariant is close to understanding what a class is.</p>

<h2>Phase 3 : DbC everywhere</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I started to write contracts everywhere. I was writing C++ code at the time, and my code must have looked something like that :</p>

<p>```c++
class MonkeyWrench
{</p>

<pre><code>bool _isStarted;
std::vector&lt;Part&gt;* _movingParts;
</code></pre>

<p>protected:</p>

<pre><code>virtual void invariant() const
{
    assert(_isStarted == (_movingParts != NULL));
}
</code></pre>

<p>public:</p>

<pre><code>MonkeyWrench()
{
    this-&gt;_isStarted = false;
    this-&gt;_movingParts = NULL;

    invariant();
}

bool isStarted() const
{
    return this-&gt;isStarted();
}

void start()
{
    assert(!this-&gt;isStarted());
    invariant();

    this-&gt;_movingParts = ...

    invariant();
    assert(this-&gt;isStarted());
}

const std::vector&lt;Part&gt;&amp; movingParts() const
{
    assert(this-&gt;isStarted());
    invariant();

    return *this-&gt;_movingParts;
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>};
```</p>

<p>I definitely over-abused contracts, it made the code unreadable. Plus sometimes, I was using excessively long and intricate assertions which made the problem even worse.</p>

<p>Hopefully, overusing contracts also taught me a lot in a short time. Here are some of the lessons I learned :</p>

<ul>
<li>DbC is not very well supported, it&rsquo;s never something built in the language, and edge cases like inheriting an invariant or conditions can become messy pretty fast.</li>
<li>Checking for intricate contracts at every method call can be pretty slow.</li>
<li>Checking everything beforehand is not always the simplest thing to do, at times, throwing an exception on failure just does a better job.</li>
<li>It happened that removing the contract made the code do just what I wanted. It&rsquo;s easy to write unnecessary strict contracts.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">Command Query Separation Principle</a> is great ! Having &lsquo;const&rsquo; or &lsquo;pure&rsquo; queries that don&rsquo;t change anything make writing contracts a lot simpler.</li>
<li>Preconditions on queries are painful. When possible, returning a sensible &lsquo;null value&rsquo; works better, nothing is worse than getting an error when trying to call a const query from the interactive debugger.</li>
<li>Finally, the more immutable a class is, the simpler the invariant. With a lot of mutable fields, you might resort to have the invariant check that fields are synchronized as expected. If fields are immutable, this simply vanishes.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Phase 4 : DbC hangover</h2>

<p>At the same time I discovered all these small subtleties about contracts, I fell upon Martin Fowler&rsquo;s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490074424&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=refactoring+improving+the+design+of+existing+code">Refactoring, improving the design of existing code</a> and started to use Unit Tests extensively. This lead me to the following conclusions :</p>

<ul>
<li>Tests are more efficient at producing quality software</li>
<li>Contracts can be an hindrance when trying to do baby steps refactorings as described in Martin Fowler&rsquo;s book</li>
</ul>


<p>On top of that, as DbC is not natively supported by languages, no documentation is generated, meaning that most of the time, the callers still have to look into the code. As a result, I was using contracts less and less often.</p>

<h2>Phase 5 : DbC Zen</h2>

<p>Looking back, I might not be writing a lot of <code>asserts</code> in my code, but I am still thinking in terms of contracts all the time. In fact, there are a ton of ways to use DbC without writing assertions :</p>

<ul>
<li>Use as much immutability as possible. An immutable class does not need to check its invariant all the time, just throwing from the constructor if arguments are not valid is enough.</li>
<li>Use conventions as much as possible, for example, constructor arguments should be set for all the life of the object (cf <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490074450&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object+oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests</a> which describes the different ways to inject something in an object)</li>
<li>Looking back at my DbC assertions, most relate to null values. Again conventions work better ! At work, we simply forbid passing null values around. If something can be null, it means it&rsquo;s optional, Java has an <code>Optional&lt;T&gt;</code> class for just that (I&rsquo;m pretty sure it is possible to do something even better with C++ templates). In this case, if the contract is broken, NullReferenceException will eventually be our assertion.</li>
<li>Replace as many pre &amp; post conditions with invariants on the callee, the arguments or the return objects as possible. It makes sense as it&rsquo;s just making sure we are using &lsquo;valid&rsquo; objects everywhere. Again, if these objects are immutable, it makes the whole thing even simpler !</li>
<li>To take further benefit of the invariant of immutable objects, introduce new types. For example, instead of changing an object&rsquo;s state through a command with associated involved contracts, split the class in 2 and make the method a query returning an immutable object, potentially making the initial class immutable as well. Remember, immutable classes mean almost no assertions !</li>
<li>Use your language. Ex, instead of asserting that 2 lists remain of the same length, refactor to a list of pairs ! (I know that&rsquo;s an obvious example, but you get the point)</li>
<li>If you are using a statically typed language, use types ! For example, I remember at one project I worked on, we had an bug involving a duration : somewhere in the code milliseconds got mistaken for seconds &hellip; We fixed that by replacing the <code>integer</code> by <code>TimeSpan</code> all over the place. Again, that&rsquo;s so obvious !</li>
<li>Eventually, when all else fails, or when it&rsquo;s just too much overhead, use the simple asserts provided by your language or common libraries.</li>
</ul>


<p>To come back at the previous code section, this how it could be written without assertions :</p>

<p>```c++
class MovingMonkeyWrench
{</p>

<pre><code>const std::vector&lt;Part&gt; _parts;
</code></pre>

<p>public:</p>

<pre><code>MovingMonkeyWrench() : _parts(...) {}

const std::vector&lt;Part&gt;&amp; parts() const
{
    return this-&gt;_parts;
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>class MonkeyWrench
{ <br/>
public:</p>

<pre><code>MovingMonkeyWrench start() const
{
    return MovingMonkeyWrench();
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>};
```</p>

<p>Details are omitted, but it&rsquo;s easy to see how shorter the code is.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>When applying all the techniques above, you&rsquo;ll see that cases for explicit assertions are rare. Less assertions also workarounds the issues coming from the poor support for DbC : no documentation and intricate cases.</p>

<p>In the end, assertions made my code more &lsquo;functional&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not alone to have done the same journey, and if you are interested you should read Eric Evans' <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490082811&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design">DDD</a> book where he presents things like immutable value objects and specification objects.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/developer-are-you-losing-your-rat-race/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-09T05:37:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/developer-are-you-losing-your-rat-race</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>A rat race is an endless, self-defeating, or pointless pursuit. It conjures up the image of the futile efforts of a lab rat trying to escape while running around a maze or in a wheel.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are we building our own <del>maze</del> self defeating landscape by our exacerbated focus on technology ? Let me explain.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2017-02-09-developer-are-you-losing-your-rat-race/rat-maze.jpg" title="A rat in a maze" ></p>

<h2>The context</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> famously said &ldquo;Software is eating the world&rdquo;, which means that there is more and more demand for software. At the same time, giant countries like China, India, Russia or Brazil are producing more and more master&rsquo;s degrees every year. This also means more and more software engineers. The consequence is that there has never been so many new technologies emerging than these days. The software landscape his huge, growing and complex.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great for progress, but it&rsquo;s a puzzle for hiring. In this chaotic environment, years of experience with a particular technology is something that remains easy to measure, that&rsquo;s why employers (and developers) tend to use keywords to cast for a job.</p>

<h2>The effects</h2>

<p>As a result, developers tend to pick a few technologies to become masters at, to put them on their CV and get job offers. There&rsquo;s a danger with specializing on a particular technology : eventually, it will become deprecated, in this keyword driven world, it&rsquo;s almost like if you&rsquo;ll have to start from zero again. Even if a specialization is wide enough now, as time goes on and more and more technologies are created, any area of expertise will become a tiny spot in all the landscape. One might think this is only an issue for old guys that did not stay up to date &hellip; I strongly believe this is wrong, it happened to all past technologies, I don&rsquo;t see why today&rsquo;s latest .js framework wouldn&rsquo;t be legacy stuff one day.</p>

<p>One could think that sticking to a good employer is a good fix against that. It is &hellip; for some time ! Sticking to an company actually means <em>betting</em> on this company. What would happen if it went out of business, or through difficult times and you&rsquo;re asked to leave ? When you reach the job market after so long with a single employer, you&rsquo;ll be a de-facto specialist, on proprietary stuff that no one is interested about.</p>

<p>Finally, you might work hard not to specialize, but it&rsquo;s going to be a lot more difficult to get a job as a generalist, only a few shops actually hire this way.</p>

<p>To summarize, we are forced into specialization, which is great in the short term, but risky in the long run.</p>

<h2>1€ advice</h2>

<p>So what can we do about this ? Obviously, we cannot change the world &hellip; The only ones we can act on are ourselves !</p>

<h3>Learning</h3>

<p>In our fast moving tech world, learning remains key ! But instead of trying to keep up with all the cool new techs that are invented every day, we should study fundamental skills, and only learn just enough specific skills to get the job done. To me fundamental skills are all the things you&rsquo;ll apply whatever the language and technology you are using, for example :</p>

<ul>
<li>design</li>
<li>architecture (whatever that is &hellip;)</li>
<li>clean code</li>
<li>refactoring</li>
<li>legacy code</li>
<li>testing</li>
<li>tooling</li>
<li>mentoring &amp; coaching</li>
<li>programming paradigms (functional, dynamic, static, imperative, OO, concurrent &hellip;)</li>
<li>process flow</li>
<li>communication</li>
<li>product definition</li>
<li>concurrency</li>
<li>performance</li>
</ul>


<p>I wrote <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-keep-up-with-software-technologies/">this post</a> that explains how I did learn some of these skills (by no mean would I say that this is the only way). Good mastery of these skills should be enough to quickly get up to speed in any project you are involved. This other article <a href="https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/in-2017-learn-every-language-59b11f68eee#.l2n6kouuz">In 2017, learn <em>every</em> language</a>, which I found through the excellent <a href="http://www.hackernewsletter.com/">hackernewsletter</a>, explains how this is possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, knowing is not enough &hellip;</p>

<h3>Selling</h3>

<p>How do you convince others that you are up to the job in a particular technology ? Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have a definitive answer yet &hellip;</p>

<p>Regularly, people try to coin a word to describe the competent generalist developer : polyglot, full stack, craftsman &hellip; If it&rsquo;s good enough, it usually gets taken over quite fast by the industry and just becomes yet another buzzword (the only exception being eXtreme Programming, but who would like to hire and eXtreme Programmer ?).</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473135683&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=soft+skills">Soft Skills</a>, John Somnez says the trick is to explain to people that you might not have experience in a technology &lsquo;yet&rsquo;. This might work, if your resume gets through, which is not sure.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my try : the next time I&rsquo;ll polish my resume, I&rsquo;ll try to put forward my fundamental skills first, for example with 5 stars self-assessments. Only after will I add something like &ldquo;By the way, I could work with tech X Y Z &hellip;&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Independence</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Jobs-Meaning-9-5/dp/1619613352/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486713381&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+end+of+jobs"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2017-02-09-developer-are-you-losing-your-rat-race/the-end-of-jobs.jpg" title="Cover of the book &lsquo;The End of Jobs&rsquo;" ></a></p>

<p>Being your own boss could be a solution in the long term. I recently listened to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Jobs-Meaning-9-5/dp/1619613352/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486713381&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+end+of+jobs">The End of Jobs</a> in which the author explains that entrepreneurship is an accessible alternative these days, and that like any skill, it&rsquo;s learnable. The catch is that there are no schools, no diplomas, and that it seems a lot riskier in the short run. Despite that, he makes the point that the skills you&rsquo;ll learn makes it quite safe in the long run !</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>I feel like my post asks more questions than it provides answers :&ndash;). Honestly, I&rsquo;d really love to read other people&rsquo;s opinions and ideas. What are your tricks to market yourself on new technologies ? As a community, what could we do to fight our planned obsolescence ? Do you think I&rsquo;m totally wrong and that the problem does not exist ? What do you think ?</p>

I got a <a href="/how-to-use-hackernews-and-reddit-for-blogging/">huge number of visits</a>, a lot more than I typically get !</p>

<p>I also got a lot more comments, some nice, some tough, some agreeable and some challenging !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2017-01-10-what-happens-to-non-enthusiast-programmers-in-the-long-run/professional.jpg" title="A logo of a guy wearing a suit" ></p>

<h2>First, a summary</h2>

<p>In this previous article, I wanted to contrast the different views about work/life balance in the software industry.</p>

<p>Some, like agile gurus and companies like Basecamp, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/working-over-40-hours-a-week-makes-you-less-productive-1725646811">studies</a>, strongly advocate for sane work hours. They explain that it results in greater productivity and healthy life.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the software field is always bubbling with novelty, and keeping up to date with technologies is by itself a challenge that takes time. For some companies, which might already be fighting for their survival against competition, it is almost impossible to grant some extra training time to their employees. The problem becomes particularly difficult when engineers get older, become parents and cannot afford to spend some extra time learning the latest JavaScript framework.</p>

<p>As a conclusion, I said that for most of us, it&rsquo;s really difficult to remain a developer in the long run without the grit that only passion for programming brings. I encourage you to <a href="/is-there-any-room-for-the-not-passionate-developer/">read it</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>What I learned from the comments</h2>

<p>First of all, thanks a lot for all these, they were very valuable, they forced me to think even more about the issue.</p>

<h3>People have been burnt !</h3>

<p>The word &lsquo;passion&rsquo; in particular, triggered engaged comments. As some pointed out, &lsquo;enthusiast&rsquo; or &lsquo;professional&rsquo; should be favored. It seems that some companies have asked their employees for unquestionable passion for their business (and not for engineering or programming) at the cost of the people&rsquo;s own lives. As a commenter said, a lot of shops do not integrate the absolute necessity for their programmers to learn continuously in their business model. It made me kind of sad to feel once more this state of our industry.</p>

<p>As a result, people are weary of any statement of &lsquo;passion&rsquo; in the workplace, and would prefer to be seen as very skilled professional, dedicated to keeping their skills up to date.</p>

<h3>The particular question of France</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2017-01-10-what-happens-to-non-enthusiast-programmers-in-the-long-run/france.jpg" title="A photo of the Eiffel tower" ></p>

<p>I received some comments from all over the world, but my observations came from where I work : in France. Here, all in all, we have at least 7 weeks of paid leaves per year. It&rsquo;s a lot more than in other parts of the world. I think it&rsquo;s around 2 weeks in the US (other <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-18/americans-work-25-more-than-europeans-study-finds">sources</a> point the same fact). Imagine two companies, one from France, and one from the US. The one in the US can invest 5 weeks per year in exploratory learning (which can result in good things for both the business and the employee) while still producing as much as the french one.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are other parameters to take into account for overall productivity like hours per day, the effects of holidays or long hours on creativity, or funding &hellip; but here are some facts about software engineering in France :</p>

<ul>
<li>20% time policy, hackathons and other exploratory learning are extremely rare (I&rsquo;ve seen it once in 15 years)</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s slowly getting better, but if you remain a programmer in your thirties, you&rsquo;re seen as a loser</li>
<li>France has no software powerhouse like Microsoft, Google, Apple &hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>This lead me to this open question : What&rsquo;s the effect of the 7 weeks of paid leaves on the french software industry ?</p>

<p>By no means will I try to give an answer, I just don&rsquo;t know. Plus, for those who might be wondering : I love my 7 weeks of holidays !</p>

<h2>The conclusion I came to</h2>

<p>Yet, I can try to draw a conclusion at the individual level. In France, if you&rsquo;re not really enthusiastic about programming, you won&rsquo;t put the extra effort off-the-job to learn the latest technologies. Within a few years, you&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;deprecated&rsquo;, which will leave you with mainly 2 options :</p>

<ul>
<li>become a manager</li>
<li>stick to your current codebase (and become completely dependent of your employer)</li>
</ul>


<p>To me, the sad truth is that if you want to make a career as a professional developer in France, you&rsquo;d better be ready to spend some of your free time practicing !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the top <a href="/top-5-talks-i-attented-at-java-one-2016-part-1/">5 talks I attended at JavaOne</a> here are more !</p>

<h2>Managing Open Source Contributions in Large Organizations</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.jamesward.com/presos">James Ward</a></p>

<p>This talk was very interesting for companies or organizations that want to use Open Source in some way without ignoring the risks.</p>

<p>After an introduction listing the benefits of contributing to open source, James explained the associated risks :</p>

<ul>
<li>Security (evil contributions or information leaks)</li>
<li>Quality (bad contributions, increased maintenance or showing a bad image)</li>
<li>Legal (responsibility in case of patent infringing contribution, ownership of a contribution, licenses)</li>
</ul>


<p>He then explained that there are 3 ways to deal with the issue :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Strategy </th>
<th> Description </th>
<th> Pros </th>
<th> Cons </th>
<th> Popularity </th>
<th> Examples </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Do nothing </td>
<td> Devs just contribute without saying it </td>
<td> Easy, Gets it done </td>
<td> Need to stay under the radar, Risks for all parties are ignores </td>
<td> +++++ </td>
<td> Most open source code on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> is shared in this manner |</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Join a foundation </td>
<td> Joining an existing open source foundation, with a framework </td>
<td> Everything out of the box (infra, governance), builds trust </td>
<td> Rules can be heavy, Ownership is given to the foundation </td>
<td> +++ </td>
<td> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a> put <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> in the <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a> |</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Build tools </td>
<td> Use your own tools to mitigate the main risks associated with the &lsquo;Do nothing&rsquo; strategy </td>
<td> Built on top of Github, Keep control, Keeps things easy </td>
<td> Need to develop, test and operate the tools </td>
<td> + </td>
<td> Demo of a tool plugged into Github to enforce a contributor license agreement for anyone pushing a pull request |</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The &lsquo;build tools&rsquo; strategy looks promising, even if it is not yet widely used !</p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X71HrW6vC_0">the talk</a> and <a href="http://presos.jamesward.com/managing_open_source_contributions_in_large_orgs/index.html#/">the slides</a> on the authors website.</p>

<h2>Java Performance Analysis in Linux with Flame Graphs</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/">Brendan Gregg</a></p>

<p>This is what a flame graph looks like :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpu-mixedmode-vertx.svg"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-10-14-3-more-great-talks-from-javaone-2016/flamegraph.png" title="An example of a Java flame graph" ></a></p>

<p>Technically, it&rsquo;s just an SVG with some Javascript. It shows the performance big picture. It aggregates data from Linux and JVM profilers. Vertically, you can see the call stacks in your system. The larger a block, the more time is taken inside a function (or in a sub call). The top border is where the CPU time is actually taken. If you want to speed up your system, speed up the wider zones at the top of the graph.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>, the speaker is a performance engineer, and his job is to build tools to help other teams discover performance issues. This is how they use Flame Graphs :</p>

<ul>
<li>Compare 2 flame graphs at different times to see what changed</li>
<li>Do a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html">canary release</a> and compare the new flame graph before finishing the deployment</li>
<li>Taking continuous flame graphs on running services helps identify JVM behavior like JIT or GC</li>
<li>They use different color themes to highlight different things</li>
<li>They also use them to identify CPU cache misses</li>
</ul>


<p>By the way, I also thought this was a great example of using an innovative visualization to manage tons of data.</p>

<p>I could find neither the video nor the slides of the talk, but I managed to find a lot of <a href="https://www.google.fr/search?safe=active&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=810&amp;tbm=vid&amp;q=Flame+Graphs&amp;oq=Flame+Graphs&amp;gs_l=serp.3...1396.1396.0.1616.1.1.0.0.0.0.59.59.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..0.0.0.z-3ygDHx4-Q">others talks about Flame Graphs</a>, as well as extra material on <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">the speaker&rsquo;s homepage</a>.</p>

<h2>Increasing Code Quality with Gamification</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alex90_ch">Alexander Chatzizacharias</a></p>

<p>You might be wondering why we should care about gamification ?</p>

<ul>
<li>Worldwide 11.2 billion hours are spent playing every week !</li>
<li>People love to play because it makes them feel awesome</li>
<li>Games are good teachers</li>
<li>At work we are the ones who need to make others successful</li>
<li>But only 32% of workers are engaged in their work !</li>
</ul>


<p>Games rely on 4 main dynamics :</p>

<ul>
<li>Competition (be very careful of closed economics which can be very bad for teams)</li>
<li>Peer pressure (Public stats push teams and individual to conform to the norm)</li>
<li>Progression (regular recognition of new skills is motivating)</li>
<li>Rewards (Badges, Level ups, Monkey Money, real money &hellip;)</li>
</ul>


<p>He went on to demonstrate two games that are based on Jenkins and Sonar that aim at better code quality :</p>

<ul>
<li>One mobile app developed during a 24h Hackathon at CGI which might be open sourced at some point</li>
<li>Another one called &lsquo;Dev Cube&rsquo; created at an university, where you get to decorate you virtual cubicle</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfT2_HxOQdk"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-10-14-3-more-great-talks-from-javaone-2016/quincy-adams.jpg" title="The speaker demoing his code quality game" ></a></p>

<p>At the end of the talk, he gave the following recommendations :</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand the needs of all to respond to everyone&rsquo;s personal goals</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t assign things to do, that&rsquo;s not fun, give rewards instead</li>
<li>Keep managers out of the picture</li>
<li>To keep it going, you need regular improvements, special events and new rules</li>
<li>KISS !</li>
</ul>


<p>Playing at work might not be unproductive in the end !</p>

<p>The same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfT2_HxOQdk">talk given at NLJug</a>, unfortunately, it&rsquo;s in Dutch. English slides are <a href="https://static.rainfocus.com/oracle/oow16/sess/14625567983370011wPS/ppt/increasing%20code%20quality%20with%20gamification.pdf">here</a> though.</p>
