    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The CFO&rsquo;s debt is visible in his balance sheet. The CTO&rsquo;s technical debt is invisible. What about making it visible ?</p>

<p>Developers have an intuitive sense of the technical debt in some parts of the system. But few have an accurate estimation of its full extent. Even the size of a code base is difficult to grasp. In the same way, the size of the code is just a number. But the fact are there : between 10 000 and 10 000 000 lines of code, the rules aren&rsquo;t the same, but it&rsquo;s only invisible data on hard drives &hellip;</p>

<h2>Showing It</h2>

<p>If we had a device or a trick to show to non-developers the size of the source code, people might start to feel the embarrassment of working in a bloated code base. Unfortunately, for the moment, the only ideas I had are somehow unrealistic, albeit funny !</p>

<h3>First Idea : Printouts</h3>

<p>Suppose we printed all the source code every Monday, and then keep it around for everyone to feel its size. We could leave it in the middle of the place, or in the CTO&rsquo;s office, so that he&rsquo;d actually be hindered by the space loss. The larger the code, the bigger the troubles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to print 50 lines on a sheet of paper, that&rsquo;s 100 on both sides.
That&rsquo;s 50 000 in a pack of 500 pages. And eventually, 200 000 in this kind of standard case :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-06-08-the-size-of-code/paper-case.jpg" title="A 2000 sheets paper case" ></p>

<p>Keeping these printouts in sync with the real cost would make the thing even more <del>painful</del> realistic. Imagine all the printings costs, and moving around cases of paper every day &hellip; ;)</p>

<h3>Second Idea : Inflatable Device</h3>

<p>What about an inflatable device linked to <a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> (or any other code metrics tracking system) ? It could grow as new code is written. We could make it as large as we want : 1m<sup>3</sup> for every 10K lines of Code, making the whole office a difficult place to walk around. Try to figure out how to work with this thing in the office :</p>

<h3>Third Idea : Sand</h3>

<p>For maximum pain, let&rsquo;s use real sand instead of an inflatable device ! Imagine the mess with some sand lying around in the office. If the only way to clean up the mess was to clean up the code, surely everyone would take the issue seriously !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-06-08-the-size-of-code/sand-pile.jpg" title="A sand pile on the pavement" ></p>

<h2>Final Word</h2>

<p>Obviously, these are jokes, but I guess there&rsquo;s a real need there. If we managed to make non developers feel the size and cost of the code base, it would be easier to agree on priorities.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-06-06-legacy-code-coverall-day/miners.jpg" title="Miners going to work in Coveralls" ></p>

<p>Some days, coding feels like speleology or mining &hellip; Dealing with weird and undocumented old logic can even some time be <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-keep-your-sanity-while-working-on-a-Super-Dirty-Rotten-Spaghetti-codebase">damaging to the mind</a> ! I think we should go to work wearing the adequate protection !</p>

<p>OK, maybe we cannot start to go to work wearing a coverall everyday, but let&rsquo;s say very 21st of June is now legacy code day, the day when every developer maintaining legacy code comes to work dressed like that !</p>

<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s a joke, but it could attract the attention of other non-coding people on the state of <em>their</em> codebase and amount of <em>their</em> technical debt.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think I found a way to fix the dirty code problem once and for all &hellip;</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</a> Zaphod Beeblebrox has some anti panic glasses. They feature some special danger detection mechanism that turns them opaque black to save their bearer from panicking.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-06-02-anti-ugly-code-glasses/zaphod.jpg" title="Zaphod Beeblebrox" ></p>

<p><em>(It turns out that Zaphod has two heads &hellip;)</em></p>

<p>In 2016, it&rsquo;s shocking that some many hours are lost by poor developers reading ugly code.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s build anti ugly-code glasses ! We&rsquo;d just need an IDE or editor plugin, connect it to <a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">Sonar</a> in order to get the quality of the current file, and if too bad, shut the glasses black !</p>

<p>Finally the killer feature for augmented reality glasses !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Madoff would have been better off managing software projects than investing on Wall Street !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-10-01-the-technical-debt-ponzi-scheme/bernie.jpg" title="&ldquo;Madoff&rsquo;s photo in jail&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Whereas in finance, a Ponzi scheme is a sure road to jail, it seems to be the de-facto standard in software development.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Software-Debt-Inevitable-Development/dp/0321554132/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443728175&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=managing+technical+debt">Managing Software Debt</a>, hoping to find methods about how to manage technical debt with some hard numbers (instead I found some good practices to avoid it, but that&rsquo;s another story). At no place did I read that taking more debt to pay the interests of existing debt was a good practice though &hellip;</p>

<p>Thinking of it, I can remember of such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi Schemes</a> in nearly every organization I worked in. Here are a few typical manifestations I saw :</p>

<ul>
<li>writing bogus code to compensate for some other bogus code</li>
<li>creating tools to workaround existing technical debt. Ex:

<ul>
<li>exotic build tools to build some code riddled with cyclic dependencies that no sane build tool can build</li>
<li>in house tools that do 10% of what standard (open source) tools can do on code following main standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>If this goes on for too long, you can end up in a technical debt death spiral : you know debt is out of control, so taking debt becomes the only way of actually getting anything done. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s win this client now, because we won&rsquo;t be able to later &hellip;&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s like running to one&rsquo;s own ruin.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-10-01-the-technical-debt-ponzi-scheme/road-wall.jpg" title="&ldquo;A road going straight in a wall&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>If your organization is in this stage, you might think at the <a href="/a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/">&lsquo;time horizon&rsquo;</a> of your product, and discover that fixing the technical debt sometimes brings more value than getting this new client !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://www.murex.com">work</a>, we are using as we all have Android phones, we are using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=artarmin.android.scrum.poker&amp;hl=fr">Scrum Poker Cards</a> app to do our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker">planning poker</a>.</p>

<p>This usually works fine, but newcomers usually have one bad remark about it :</p>

<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not geeky enough</p></blockquote>

<p>Obviously, it also does not work if one lakes a phone, but who would come in a meeting without it nowadays ?</p>

<p>Enters the binary hand poker !</p>

<p>Now that&rsquo;s geeky ! I still have to find a symbol for the coffee cup and the question mark though &hellip;</p>
