    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/13-tricks-for-successful-side-projects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="/side-projects-matter/">I said last week</a>, I released the v0.1 of <a href="https://philous-planning-poker.herokuapp.com/">Philou&rsquo;s Planning Poker</a>, my latest side project. Although I have a day job, a wife, a family and a mortgage to pay, I still manage to finish my side projects. In the past 7 years, I published 5 of these as open source projects, website, or wannabe businesses.</p>

<p>Side projects rely on 2 things : time and motivation. If motivation goes down, you&rsquo;ll  stop working on it, and it will die. If you don&rsquo;t manage to find enough time for it, it will also die.</p>

<p>Over the years, I accumulated best practices that increase the chances of success. Here is a shortlist of 13 of these.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/"><img src="../imgs/2017-06-19-13-tricks-for-successful-side-projects/Strip-Side-project.jpg" alt="A comic strip about side projects" /></a></p>

<h2>1. Know your goal</h2>

<p>As I said before, side projects are time constrained. If you try to follow many goals at once, you&rsquo;ll spread too thin and won&rsquo;t deliver anything. That will kill your motivation.</p>

<p>To avoid this, you need to decide on a unique goal for your project. It can be anything : learning a new tech, building a tool, sell a simple product, maintain a blog.</p>

<p>Depending on the nature of your goal, your side project can take different forms. <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-i-got-my-feet-wet-with-machine-learning-with-the-first-20-hours/">20 hours experiments</a> are great for learning new techs. As a side note, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MOOC">MOOCs</a> can also be very effective for this. If you want to start a business, start a <a href="http://www.allencheng.com/concierge-mvp/">lean startup concierge MVP</a>. Finally, if you already know users who need a tool, build a minimalistic version for them.</p>

<h2>2. Time box your work</h2>

<p>Time boxing will force you to make the choices that will keep you going forward. The risk is to take on too many topics : more refactoring, more UI polish, more options, more bells and whistles. All these can be very interesting and valuable, but are usually not the main priority.</p>

<p>20 hours programs are time boxes, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons they work. For other kinds of side projects, I do a quarterly prioritization. &ldquo;This is what I&rsquo;d like to have in 3 months&rdquo;. I often slip a bit, but that&rsquo;s not a problem as long as I stay focused on my goal.</p>

<h2>3. Setup a routine</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to dedicate time to your side project. Think of what you could do if you worked one hour per day to it. 365 hours per year, or 90 hours per quarter ! That&rsquo;s 2 full weeks of work !</p>

<p>In the long run, having a routine is more effective than anything else. After a few weeks of sticking to a routine, it will become part of your daily life, and won&rsquo;t be an effort anymore. It will also help to forecast what you&rsquo;ll be able to do in the coming month or so.</p>

<p>To setup a routine, block a slot in your day to work on your project, and stick to it. My own routine is waking up early to have some focused time. I have entrepreneur friends who did the same. <a href="http://grasshopper.com/">GrassHopper</a> founder says the same in this <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/003-david-hauser-of-grasshopper">Indiehacker podcast</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Keep delivering to sustain motivation</h2>

<p>Nothing kills motivation as not delivering. At work, I can go on without user feedback for a while (<a href="/how-long-can-your-inner-drive-last/">not too long though</a>). Unfortunately, that does not work on a time constrained side project. We have only one life and we don&rsquo;t want to spend our time on things that don&rsquo;t matter. Things that don&rsquo;t deliver don&rsquo;t matter &hellip;</p>

<p>To get the technical aspect of delivery out of the picture once and for all, I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498106027&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=continuous+delivery">Continuous Delivery</a>. Continuous Delivery is pretty easy to start with on a new project :</p>

<ul>
<li>automate all your tests</li>
<li>setup a CI server</li>
<li>deploy when the CI passes</li>
</ul>


<p>Once this is up and running, as long as I split my work in baby steps, I&rsquo;ll be delivering.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498106027&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=continuous+delivery"><img src="../imgs/2017-06-19-13-tricks-for-successful-side-projects/continuous-delivery.jpg" alt="The cover of the continuous delivery book" /></a></p>

<h2>5. Use SasS tools</h2>

<p>Setting up a CI and a deployment server can take some time. In 2017 though, online platforms make this very easy. Use as many as you can.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://philous-planning-poker.herokuapp.com/">Philou&rsquo;s Planning Poker</a>, I save my code on <a href="https://github.com/philou/planning-poker">Github</a>, test through <a href="https://travis-ci.org/philou/planning-poker">Travis CI</a> and deploy to <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com">Heroku</a>. I also use <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/philou/planning-poker">Code Climate</a> for static code analysis.</p>

<p>Most of these tools have some free plans for small or open source projects. That alone is a great advantage of making your project open source !</p>

<h2>6. Pay for good tools</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to make your project open source, consider paying for these services. How much you value your time will tell you whether to buy or not.</p>

<p>There are other things you should pay for as well. I definitely recommend paying for a good laptop and IDE.</p>

<p>Remember, anything that helps you to deliver also helps you to keep your motivation high. You have a day job that earns you money, so use it !</p>

<h2>7. Pick a productive language </h2>

<p>Depending on your project, you&rsquo;ll have a choice in which programming language to use.</p>

<p>Paul Graham advices to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">use dynamic languages</a>. I tend to do the same, especially after watching <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/dynamic-static-typing">&ldquo;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Dynamic Typing for Practical Programs&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/dynamic-static-typing"><img src="../imgs/2017-06-19-13-tricks-for-successful-side-projects/dynamic-typing-pres.jpg" alt="A presentation about dynamic typing" /></a></p>

<p>In the end, I guess it&rsquo;s a matter of personal preference. Pick the language you&rsquo;ll be the most productive with.</p>

<h2>8. Use a popular platform</h2>

<p>Use a popular open source platform to build your side project on. Useless to say, if your goal is to learn X, use X, even if it is not popular !</p>

<p>There are many advantages to using a popular platform :</p>

<ul>
<li>you&rsquo;ll have something that has already been production proofed</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll suffer less bugs (remember Linus&rsquo;s Law <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law">&ldquo;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&rdquo;</a>)</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll get help from the community</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll find compatible libraries to solve some of your problems</li>
</ul>


<p>The end goal is always the same : sustain your motivation by delivering fast enough !</p>

<h2>9. Walk the edge</h2>

<p>We don&rsquo;t start side project to spend time updating dependencies. The saying goes <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.html">&ldquo;If it hurts, do it more often&rdquo;</a>. To save your productivity and motivation, always keep your dependencies up to date.</p>

<p>This is easy with automated test and continuous integration in place. I use no version constraint, but update all dependencies at least every week. I  commit if all tests pass. Sometimes I fall into small 5 to 10 minutes fixes, but that&rsquo;s all it takes.</p>

<h2>10. Take technical debt</h2>

<p>When starting a new side project, you have no ideas how long it will last. Could be one week, for example if you started a 20h experiment at the beginning of holidays. Could also be 20 years, if you managed to transform this side project into a full fledged business.</p>

<p>Starting with all the practices that make large software systems manageable will fail. You won&rsquo;t deliver fast enough. By now, you know the story, if you don&rsquo;t deliver, you&rsquo;ll lose your motivation.</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/a-seamless-way-to-keep-track-of-technical-debt-in-your-source-code/"><code>TODO</code> comments</a> in my latest side project to keep track of the shortcut I took. I found it had 2 main advantages in my situation :</p>

<ul>
<li>I had a quick view of how much total technical debt I took</li>
<li>if things get more serious, it will be easy to find improvement points</li>
</ul>


<p>I know that <code>TODO</code> comments are <a href="https://techbeacon.com/useless-comments-can-ruin-code-review-heres-how-erase-them">controversial in the software community</a>. In the context of new side projects though, they make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>My advice is to take technical debt !</p>

<h2>11. Use your day job</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying to use time from your day job to work on your side project. That would be like stealing. Your day job can help your side project in many other ways.</p>

<p>One I already mentioned is using your income to buy better tools.</p>

<p>If you have <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack Time</a> at your day job, you could use it to start a side project that benefits your company. You&rsquo;ll need to make sure that this kind of arrangement does not pose any IP issues. It can result in a win-win situation.</p>

<p>Another way is to find subjects at work which will grow some skills that are also useful for your side project.</p>

<h2>12. Talk about it</h2>

<p>Talking about your side project serves many purposes :</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s an unofficial engagement to work on it</li>
<li>it provides feedback</li>
<li>it could attract early users</li>
</ul>


<p>To summarize, the more you&rsquo;ll talk about it the more it will become &lsquo;real&rsquo;. You can share your side project anywhere : blog, Meetups, work, with friends or family. Depending on your topic, some places will work better than others.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid that one might steal your idea. A side project is small, not yet rocket science. It&rsquo;s usually too small to be on the radar of serious businesses, and too big for individuals.</p>

<p>Let me explain that. Very few people have the grit to turn their ideas into something real. If you encounter someone who has the grit and the interest, ask her to join forces !</p>

<h2>13. Find real users</h2>

<p>Deploying your software is nice, but it&rsquo;s useless until you have users. Find some ! It&rsquo;s never too early to find testers. If your first demo does not embarrass you, it was too late ! At the beginning, it can be as basic as walking through an unfinished feature to get feedback.</p>

<p>Real user feedback always results in both high motivation and value. There are many places to get beta users : at work, through friends &hellip; have the courage to ask !</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s again a case for building your system in baby steps. The faster you get to something you can show, the faster you can have beta users.</p>

<h2>Do it !</h2>

<p>If I needed a 14th best practice it would be to start today ! As with most things, just do it !</p>

    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/side-projects-matter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a manager, you could benefit a lot from helping your developers with their side projects.</p>

<p>I finished my <a href="https://philous-planning-poker.herokuapp.com/">latest side project</a>. That&rsquo;s the fifth serious one I bring to an end :</p>

<ol>
<li>2010-2014 <a href="/rip-mes-courses-dot-fr/">www.mes-courses.fr</a>, an improved UI for online groceries. This was both a technical project and a wannabe business</li>
<li>Since 2011, <a href="/">this blog</a></li>
<li>2015 <a href="/agileavatars-dot-com-magnets-for-real/">www.agileavatars.com</a>, a custom magnet shop for agile team boards. This was a lean startup style business project</li>
<li>2016 <a href="/verify-the-big-o-complexity-of-ruby-code-in-rspec/">complexity-asserts</a> a unit test matcher to enforce algorithm complexity. This was a technical project time boxed to 20h.</li>
<li>2016-2017 <a href="/planning-poker/">Philou&rsquo;s Planning Poker</a>, a technical product, that I built to solve my own problem.</li>
</ol>


<p>The more I do side projects, the more I am certain of their value to my employer.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-06-13-side-projects-matter/side-project.jpg" alt="Hand drawing with stating 'creative business idea'" /><div class="image-credits"><a href='http://fr.freepik.com/vecteurs-libre/dessines-a-la-main-business-icons_769576.htm'>Designed by Freepik</a></div></p>

<h2>Reasons companies discourage side projects</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, most companies discourage their employees to have side projects. It boils down to fundamental fears :</p>

<ul>
<li>they might get less done</li>
<li>they might leave</li>
</ul>


<p>While these are legitimate, most of the time, they are also unlikely or short sighted.</p>

<h3>Why don&rsquo;t they work extra hours ?</h3>

<p>Said another way : if developers want to code, why don&rsquo;t they add new features to the company&rsquo;s products ?</p>

<p>From my own experience, having a side project has always been an <a href="/is-there-any-room-for-the-not-passionate-developer/">energy booster</a>. Side projects have made me more effective at work !</p>

<p>For a compulsive hacker, a side project is a hobby ! As painting, piano or soccer is to others. Working on smaller software, being in full control, renews the joy of programming.</p>

<h3>They&rsquo;ll quit once they&rsquo;ve learned new skills !</h3>

<p>Simply said, if a company&rsquo;s retention strategy is to deprecate its developers &hellip; It&rsquo;s got problems a lot worse than a few people doing side projects at night !</p>

<h3>They won&rsquo;t be as productive !</h3>

<p>You could think that developers will be less focused on the company&rsquo;s issues while at work. Indeed, passionate side-project hackers always have it on top of their heads.</p>

<p>Most of the time though, the extra energy provided by the side project out-weights this focus loss.</p>

<p>In the end, we should trust people to be professional. Let&rsquo;s deal with the problem later, when someone actually starts to underdeliver.</p>

<h3>They&rsquo;ll leave if it turns into a successful product !</h3>

<p>Building a product company is pretty damn hard. A time starved side project is pretty unlikely to turn into a successful business. Not much to worry about here ! If it happens, the company is lucky to have had such a productive employee.</p>

<h3>They might steal our intellectual property !</h3>

<p>This one is true. Only a very small minority of people might do that, but the risk remains.</p>

<p>You might conclude that it&rsquo;s easier to play it safe and prohibit side projects &hellip; at the same time, it&rsquo;s always sad to punish the majority for a minority&rsquo;s bad behavior.</p>

<p>It boils down to a tradeoff between risks and rewards. How sensible the company is to IP theft vs the benefits of having a side-project friendly policy.</p>

<p>If you are wondering what these benefits are, read on !</p>

<h2>Side projects made me a more valuable employee</h2>

<p>As developers, side project teach us a lot. What is less obvious, is how these new skills benefit our employers !</p>

<h3>Keep up with technology</h3>

<p>A side project is an occasion to work on any subject, with any technology we want. That&rsquo;s the perfect time to try that latest <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/javascript-frameworks/">JS</a> framework we cannot use at work.</p>

<p>This will help us and our companies to transition to these new technologies in the future.</p>

<p>Experimenting different platforms also widens our horizons. It teaches us new ways of addressing problems in our daily stack. For examples, learning <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/267862/what-makes-lisp-macros-so-special">LISP macros</a> pushed me to use lambdas to create new control structures in Java, C++ or C#.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that side projects make people more productive and adaptive. Which in turn makes companies more productive and resilient</p>

<h3>Understand what technical debt is</h3>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-06-13-side-projects-matter/iceberg-technical-debt.jpg" alt="A technical debt iceberg" /><div class="image-credits"><a href='https://www.vectorcast.com/testing-solutions/technical-debt-legacy-code'>Image from Vector Software</a></div></p>

<p>The bottleneck in a side project is always time. In this context, to deliver fast enough to keep my motivation high, I tend to take technical debt. Particularly because I ignore how long I&rsquo;ll be maintaining this code.</p>

<p>Even so, if I later decide to stick to this side project, this technical debt will be an issue.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what technical debt is : a conscious choice to cut a corner and fix it later. Without keeping track of the cut corners, it&rsquo;s not debt anymore, but crappy code ! That&rsquo;s why I ended up using <a href="/a-seamless-way-to-keep-track-of-technical-debt-in-your-source-code/"><code>#TODO</code> comments</a> in my side projects.</p>

<p>Later down the road, at any moment, I can decide to invest in refactoring some technical debt out. We can apply the exact same principles at our day jobs.</p>

<h3>Understanding what a business is</h3>

<p>Trying to make money from your side project taught me other kind of lessons. To sell my product or service, I had to learn a ton of other skills than the typical developer has. Nothing will sell without marketing or sales. I also had to dip my toes in design, web content creation and project management.</p>

<p>Once I went through this, I was able to better understand a big picture at work. It became easier to discuss with product, project and sales people. I&rsquo;m able to make better tradeoffs between engineering, product and technical debt. Non technical colleagues appreciate that. As developers, it increases our value and trustworthiness.</p>

<h3>Discover new ways of doing things</h3>

<p>While progressing towards my own side project goals, I had to search the internet for help on some tasks. I ended up using SaaS tools, and discovered alternate practices to the ones I was using in my daily job.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great for employers ! Developers will gain perspective about which company processes work well and which don&rsquo;t. If you have some form of continuous improvement in place at work, they&rsquo;ll suggest great ideas ! If you don&rsquo;t, then you should <a href="/how-we-introduced-efficient-agile-retrospectives/">start doing retrospectives</a> now !</p>

<h2>Companies should sponsor side projects</h2>

<p>I hope I convinced you that side projects are at least as efficient as a formal training. The topics are unknown at the beginning, but that&rsquo;s the trick : they deal with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">unknown unknowns</a> !</p>

<p>There are many ways a company can help its employees with their side projects :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack time</a> is a great way to spark the interest in a topic. Developers might start something in their slack time, and continue as a side project. Provided the topic as value for the company, they could continue using their Slack time on it.</li>
<li>Hosting a <a href="https://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathon</a>. Most company offices are empty on Saturdays and Sundays. You could ask your company to lend its premises for such an event. It&rsquo;s very likely that some employees will take part.</li>
<li>Even better, some companies, like <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2013/02/15/organizing-a-hack-week/">Spotify</a>, organize regular Hackathons <em>on office hours</em> ! That&rsquo;s Slack time, on steroids !</li>
<li>Sponsoring internal communities can enable employees with side-projects to help each other. Sponsorship could be free lunch, premises or a regular small slice of time on work hours.</li>
<li>Providing a clear legal framework around side projects reduces the risks for everyone. Questions like the ownership of intellectual property are better dealt with upfront.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2013/02/15/organizing-a-hack-week/"><img src="../imgs/2017-06-13-side-projects-matter/spotify-hackathon.jpg" alt="A photo of Spotify's open space during a Hackathon" /></a></p>

<p>If you are a developer looking for a side project idea, suggest slack time in retrospective ! You could also ask for sponsorship and organize a startup week-end or a lunch time community.</p>

<p>Finally, if your company is side-project friendly, communicate about it ! It&rsquo;s a great selling point and it will attract great programmers.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/speed-up-the-tdd-feedback-loop-with-better-assertion-messages/"/>
    <updated>2017-05-29T06:37:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/speed-up-the-tdd-feedback-loop-with-better-assertion-messages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a rather widespread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> practice to have a <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/7823/is-it-ok-to-have-multiple-asserts-in-a-single-unit-test">single assertion per test</a>. The goal is to have faster feedback loop while coding. When a test fails, it can be for a single reason, making the diagnostic faster.</p>

<p>The same goes with the test names. When a test fails, a readable test name in the report simplifies the diagnostic. Some testing frameworks allow the use of plain strings as test names. In others, people use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming">underscores</a>#Multiple-word_identifiers) instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">CamelCase</a> in test names.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-05-29-speed-up-the-tdd-feedback-loop-with-better-assertion-messages/rubymine.jpg" alt="RubyMine test report" /></p>

<h2>A 4th step in TDD: Fail, <em>Fail better</em>, Pass, Refactor</h2>

<h3>First, make it fail</h3>

<p>Everyone knows that Test Driven Development starts by making the test fail. Let me illustrate why.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I was working on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29">C#</a> project. We were using TDD and <a href="https://github.com/nunit/nunit">NUnit</a>. At some point, while working on a story, I forgot to make my latest test fail. I wrote some code to pass this test, I ran the tests, and they were green. When I was almost done, I tried to plug all the parts together, but nothing was working. I had to start the debugger to understand what was going wrong. At first, I could not understand why the exact thing I had unit tested earlier was now broken. After more investigation I discovered that I had forgotten to make my test public. NUnit only runs public tests &hellip;</p>

<p>If I had made sure my test was failing, I would have spotted straightaway that it was not ran.</p>

<h3>Then make it fail &hellip; better !</h3>

<p>I lived the same kind of story with wrong failures many times. The test fails, but for a bad reason. I move on to implement the code to fix it &hellip; but it still does not pass ! Only then do I check the error message and discover the real thing to fix. Again, it&rsquo;s a transgression to baby steps and to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a> principle. If the tests is small, that might not be too much of an issue. But it can be if the test is big, or if the real fix deprecates all the premature work.</p>

<h3>Strive for explicit error message</h3>

<p>The idea is to make sure to have good enough error messages before moving on to the &ldquo;pass&rdquo; step.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080583&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-29-speed-up-the-tdd-feedback-loop-with-better-assertion-messages/growing.jpg" alt="Cover of GOOSGT" /></a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing groundbreaking about this practice. It&rsquo;s not a step as explicit as the other 3 steps of TDD. The first place I read about this idea was in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080583&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests</a>.</p>

<h2>How to improve your messages</h2>

<h3>Readable code</h3>

<p>Some test frameworks print out the failed assertion code to the test failure report. Others, especially in dynamic languages, use the assertion code itself to deduce an error message. If your test code is readable enough, your error messages might be as well !</p>

<p>For example, with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> testing framework :</p>

<p><code>ruby
it "must have an ending" do
  expect(Vote.new(team: @daltons)).to be_valid
end
</code></p>

<p>Yield the following error :</p>

<p>```
expected #<Vote ...> to be valid, but got errors: Ending can&rsquo;t be blank</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Pass in a message argument</h3>

<p>Sometimes, readable code is not enough to provide good messages. All testing frameworks I know provide some way to pass in a custom error message. That&rsquo;s often a cheap and straightforward way to clarify your test reports.</p>

<p>```ruby
  it &ldquo;should not render anything&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>post_create
expect(response.code).to eq(HTTP::Status::OK.to_s),
                         "expected the post to succeed, but got http status #{response.code}"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<p>Yields</p>

<p><code>
expected the post to succeed, but got http status 204
</code></p>

<h3>Define your own matchers</h3>

<p>The drawback with explicit error message is that they harm code readability. If this becomes too much of an issue, one last solution is the use of <a href="https://objectpartners.com/2013/09/18/the-benefits-of-using-assertthat-over-other-assert-methods-in-unit-tests/">test matchers</a>. A test matcher is a class encapsulating assertion code. The test framework provides a fluent api to bind a matcher with the actual and expected values. Almost all test framework support some flavor of these. If not, or if you want more, there are libraries that do :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/index.html">AssertJ</a> is a fluent assertion library for Java. You can easily extend it with your own assertions (ie. matchers)</li>
<li><a href="http://n-fluent.net/">NFluent</a> is the same thing for .Net.</li>
</ul>


<p>As an example, in a past side project, I defined an <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/blob/master/spec/support/include_all_matcher.rb">include_all</a> rspec matcher that verifies that many elements are present in a collection. It can be used that way :</p>

<p><code>ruby
expect(items).to include_all(["Tomatoes", "Bananas", "Potatoes"])
</code></p>

<p>It yields error messages like</p>

<p><code>
["Bananas", "Potatoes"] are missing
</code></p>

<p>A custom matcher is more work, but it provides both readable code and clean error messages.</p>

<h2>Other good points of matchers</h2>

<p>Like any of these 3 tactics, matchers provide better error messages. Explicit error messages, in turn, speed up the diagnostic on regression. In the end, faster diagnostic means easier maintenance.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s more awesomness in custom test matchers !</p>

<h3>Adaptive error messages</h3>

<p>In a custom matcher, you have to write code to generate the error message. This means we can add logic there ! It&rsquo;s an opportunity to build more detailed error messages.</p>

<p>This can be particularly useful when testing recursive (tree-like) structures. A few years ago, I wrote an rspec matcher library called <a href="https://github.com/philou/xpath-specs">xpath-specs</a>. It checks html views for the presence of recursive XPath. Instead of printing</p>

<p><code>
Could not find //table[@id="grades"]//span[text()='Joe'] in ...
</code></p>

<p>It will print</p>

<p><code>
Could find //table[@id="grades"] but not //table[@id="grades"]//span[text()='Joe'] in ...
</code></p>

<p>(BTW, I&rsquo;m still wondering if testing views this way is a good idea &hellip;)</p>

<h3>Test code reuse</h3>

<p>One of the purpose of custom test matchers is to be reusable. That&rsquo;s a good place to factorize assertion code. It is both more readable and more organized than extracting an assertion method.</p>

<h3>Better coverage</h3>

<p>I noticed that custom matcher have a psychological effect on test coverage ! A matcher is a place to share assertion code. Adding thorough assertions seems legitimate, contrary to repeating them inline.</p>

<h3>Avoids mocking</h3>

<p>We often resort to mocks instead of side effect tests because it&rsquo;s a lot shorter. A custom matcher encapsulates the assertion code. It makes it OK to use a few assertions to test for side effects, which is usually preferable to mocking.</p>

<p>For example, here is a matcher that checks that our remote service API received the correct calls, without doing any mocking.</p>

<p>```ruby
RSpec::Matchers.define :have_received_order do |cart, credentials|
  match do |api|</p>

<pre><code>not api.nil? and
api.login == credentials.email and
api.password == credentials.password and
cart.lines.all? do |cart_line|
  cart.content.include?(cart_line.item.remote_id)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  failure_message do |api|</p>

<pre><code>"expected #{api.inspect} to have received order #{cart.inspect} from #{credentials}"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h2>Care about error messages</h2>

<p>Providing good error messages is a small effort compared to unit testing in general. At the same time, it speeds up the feedback loop, both while coding and during later maintenance. Imagine how easier it would be to analyze and fix regressions if they all had clear error messages !</p>

<p>Spread the word ! Leave comments in code reviews, demo the practice to your pair buddy. Prepare a team coding dojo about custom assertion matchers. Discuss the issue in a retro !</p>

    <updated>2017-05-15T06:53:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> a long time ago. Since then, even though I&rsquo;m still not a master, it&rsquo;s been my most useful programming skill, by far. TDD is the first trick every new programmer should learn. It made my whole career as a developer easier.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a professional software engineer for more than 15 years, including around 10 years in the trading industry. Only once did I need to work on week ends or late into the night to fix emergency issues. I believe I largely owe this work-life balance to the high test coverage that TDD ensures by design.</p>

<p>TDD also enables safe refactoring. Refactoring enables <a href="/incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/">incremental design</a> which lets you decide late. Deciding late is how you make your customers happy by accepting late changes. Deciding late is how take up-front design easy, and improve your code as you go. Deciding late is how you build trustful and harmonious relationships with the stakeholders of your project.</p>

<p>Finally, writing tests before the code is both easier and more fun. Among compilation errors and never ending customer demands, the recurring green barre tastes like pure candy to the poor programmer !</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/road.jpg" alt="A long winding road" /><div class="image-credits">From <a href="https://fr.pinterest.com/explore/winding-road/">Pinterest winding road catalog</a></div></p>

<h2>The TDD Road</h2>

<p>Here are the steps I took to learn TDD.</p>

<h3>Learn the principles</h3>

<p>The principles of Test Driven Development are fairly basic. 5 minutes is enough to know them forever :</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a failing test</li>
<li>Make it pass by doing the simplest thing possible</li>
<li>Refactor your code while keeping the tests passing</li>
<li>Repeat until your acceptance test is green</li>
</ol>


<p>TDD newbies might ask a few questions like :</p>

<ul>
<li>Is making the code compile in step 1 or 2 ? Honestly, that does not matter. Write the test as if you had the code, then make it compile, make sure it fails, and continue.</li>
<li>How much should I refactor ? It often takes a good amount of experimentation to find your good balance. If you don&rsquo;t refactor enough, you going to drown in dirty code. If you refactor too much, you&rsquo;re going to waste your time (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html">YAGNI</a>). As a rule of thumb, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html">Kent Beck&rsquo;s</a> rules on simple design are a very good starting point :</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/beck-rules.jpg" alt="A visual graph of Kent Beck's rules of simple design" /></a><div class="image-credits"><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html">From Martin Fowler : Beck Design Rules</a></div></p>

<h3>Find your tools</h3>

<p>Back in 2003, after reading <a href="TODO">Martin Fowler</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080119&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=martin+fowler+refactoring">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a> book, I decided to give TDD a serious try. I was using C++ at work but we did not even have a nightly build. I had to download and setup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CppUnit">CppUnit</a> on my own. As solo endeavor, this was a required step to get into TDD.</p>

<p>Find and setup a tool. Which one should be rather obvious, if your team already uses a unit test framework, stick to it, otherwise, pick the most standard for your language, ex : <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> for <a href="https://www.java.com">Java</a> (you might as well start searching for a new job where they use a unit testing tool).</p>

<h3>Train at a TDD coding dojo</h3>

<p><a href="http://codingdojo.org/">Coding dojos</a> were first invented as a tool to <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/">learn TDD</a>. They were started by two french eXtreme Programmers <a href="https://ut7.fr/">Emmanuel Gaillot</a> and <a href="http://institut-agile.fr/">Laurent Bossavit</a>. It happens that I live in Paris, and that Emmanuel came to work as a contractor at the same company I was. I learned that he was organizing a weekly coding dojo open to any developer. That&rsquo;s how I started attending coding dojos. Looking back, the TDD skills I learned at the coding dojo are just enormous !</p>

<p>If you are serious about learning TDD, attend coding dojos. Whether you find one in your city (ask <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a>) or in your company does not really matter. If you cannot find any, just start one at work ! Send a public call for interested people (use wiki, mail, posters or whatever), book a room and start hacking ! <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Dojo-Handbook-Emily-Bache/dp/919811803X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494908749&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coding+dojo">Emily Bache&rsquo;s Coding Dojo Handbook</a> seems a very good reference about how to start a coding dojo (Disclaimer : I did not read the book, I only know it by reputation.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Dojo-Handbook-Emily-Bache/dp/919811803X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494908749&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coding+dojo"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/coding-dojo.jpg" alt="Cover of The Coding Dojo Handbook" /></a></p>

<h3>Use it</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a professional programmer, you must be spending most of your time writing code. Take this opportunity to use TDD. You&rsquo;ll be slowed down a bit at the beginning, but as both your code and your skills improve, you&rsquo;ll get your time back manyfold.</p>

<p>I remember one of my first professional use of TDD was to write a small parser. A few weeks later I was asked to make it faster. Having tests around it made it easy to optimize it without breaking it.</p>

<h3>Deliberate practice</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-20-Hours-Learn-Anything/dp/1591846943/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494910468&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+first+20+hours">The first 20 hours</a>, Josh Kaufman explains that deliberately practicing specific topics is a more time effective way of learning than simply crunching hours of practice.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/tpierrain">Thomas Pierrain</a> is used to regularly practice short 30 minutes katas to sharpen his programming skills. Katas can be found at <a href="http://codingdojo.org/KataCatalogue/">codingdojo.org</a>, at <a href="http://cyber-dojo.org/">cyber-dojo.org</a> or in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Dojo-Handbook-Emily-Bache/dp/919811803X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494908749&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coding+dojo">The Coding Dojo Handbook</a>.</p>

<h3>Read</h3>

<p>Meanwhile I was doing all this, I also spent a lot of time reading on the subject. At the time, there was a lot of things about TDD in the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/">C2 Wiki</a>, so I spent a lot of time there. Since then, I stumbled upon a few books that helped me to understand some aspects of TDD :</p>

<ul>
<li>Kent Beck&rsquo;s classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080564&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tdd+by+example">TDD by example</a> remains a great reference for beginners</li>
<li>I got very useful advices from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Practical-Guide/dp/0131016490/ref=sr_1_3?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494911486&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=test+driven+practical+guide">TDD, a practical guide</a> especially the section about UI testing, which really saved me at some point</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080583&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests</a> is now a classic about what is called &ldquo;The London school of testing&rdquo;, which uses mocks as a design tool. Definitely a must read.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080583&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/growing.jpg" alt="Cover of GOOSGT" /></a></p>

<h3>Practice advanced topics</h3>

<p>The TDD road goes on forever, testing has a lot of tricky topics. Once you&rsquo;ve mastered the basics, it&rsquo;s quite interesting to explore and practice more complex subjects. Here are a few things worth trying out :</p>

<ul>
<li>Use automated IDE refactorings to keep the code compiling all the way through a kata</li>
<li>Do the same kata twice, using <a href="/flavours-of-tdd/">top-down and bottom-up</a> styles</li>
<li>Do refactoring katas to learn how to work with legacy code</li>
<li>Do UI katas, to learn how to test the UI</li>
<li>Learn how to deal with DB</li>
<li>Learn how to handle remote services</li>
</ul>


<p>If needed, invent your own katas to deliberately practice these topics and others.</p>

<h2>The pitfalls</h2>

<p>As any road worth walking, the TDD path is not linear and smooth. Before fully mastering TDD, you&rsquo;ll regularly wonder if you&rsquo;re on the right track. As any practice, TDD has pitfalls. I&rsquo;ve fell into some quite a few times. I guess that&rsquo;s part of the learning process.</p>

<h3>Emerging Design</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s always been a lot of misunderstanding around this topic.</p>

<p>Bad smells in your code make your tests harder to write. If adding a test is painful, that&rsquo;s an indication that something could be improved in your design. It&rsquo;s then up to you to know what. Once you&rsquo;ve figured out what you want to change, use your existing tests to refactor your design first. Only then, add this new test.</p>

<p>As you can see, the tests will give you more feedback about the design of your code, but they won&rsquo;t tell you what to do. That&rsquo;s where your coding skills will help. This is particularly true about algorithms. Don&rsquo;t expect a good algorithm to magically appear as you do the simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work &hellip;</p>

<p>As with any rules, there are exceptions. At times, you&rsquo;ll walk into a problem which emerging design is great. For example, I&rsquo;ve done the <a href="http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/RomanNumerals-Kata">Arab to Romans</a> kata many times, and that repeatedly doing the simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work yields a good solution.</p>

<h3>Mocks</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">Mocks</a> are useful at times, but be careful not to overuse them. I already <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/mocking/">wrote about mocks</a>. Too much mocking makes your test suite brittle, ineffective and difficult to maintain ! I&rsquo;ve been bitten hard by this one on a personal <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses">side project</a>, the day I decided to get rid of all the mocks, I shrank the test code size by 25%. Since then I learned about alternate techniques such as :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test data builders</a> which allow to easily build test data</li>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value objects</a> that are immutable and don&rsquo;t need mocking</li>
<li><a href="/my-new-gem-for-creating-rspec-proxies/">test spies and proxies</a> as a way to mock and track calls while still calling the real code</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:4000/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">in-memory fake implementations</a> which make the tests independent and fast without unmaintainable proliferation of mock setup</li>
</ul>


<p>As an indicator, less than 5% of my tests use mocks.</p>

<h3>Metrics</h3>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M">keynote at RailsConf 2014</a> DHH explains the danger of testing metrics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/dhh.jpg" alt="DHH's keynote at RailsConf 2014" /></a></p>

<p>By using TDD correctly, you should get a high code coverage as a side effect. If you get below 80%, you must be doing something wrong. The other metric you should keep an eye on is the total build time. Original <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> had the <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/ten_minute_build.html">10 minutes build rule</a> which states that if your build + tests takes more than 10 minutes, you should refactor it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it ! Things like 100% test coverage or test ratio are complete nonsense.</p>

<h2>Pushing it even further</h2>

<p>My promise, at the beginning of this post, was that Test Driven Development would make your life as a developer easier. Now let&rsquo;s imagine that your whole team or company was using TDD. It&rsquo;s a foundation on which to build a sustainable agile organization.</p>

<p>The mastery of automated testing at organization scale is a key element to continuous delivery, making releasing software a non-event, and as stress-free as possible.</p>

<p>Full adoption of TDD can yield to <a href="/incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/">incremental architecture</a> which delivers features faster, by skipping the conflictual arguments about supposed future needs.</p>

<p>Finally, TDD can simplify your processes and tooling. Team-wide TDD results in a steady flow of features on top of which it is easier to create simple and effective processes and tools.</p>

<p>The road is long, sinuous and at times rocky, but so are the rewards.</p>
