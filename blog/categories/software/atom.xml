    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last time I tried to insert a code snippet in my <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blog, I was hurt by the following error :</p>

<p>```

<p>I had been switching to <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> in <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to host my Octopress installation, but that did not seem related &hellip;</p>

<h2>Plan A : Upgrade Octopress</h2>

<p>It turned out it was related to my migration to Vagrant and Docker.xs This kind of nasty error often comes from obsolete environment. <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1173">Internet confirmed</a> confirmed it :</p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu now uses Python3 instead of Python2</li>
<li>Octopress2 uses an old version of Pygments</li>
<li>That version of Pygments requires Python2</li>
</ul>


<p>I thought that I did not want to play <a href="/ruby-thirdparties-best-practices/">this game</a> against open source libs, so I set out to update. Octopress 3 has been released. It&rsquo;s not yet documented yet, and there is no official upgrade guide, but some guys have done it :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://samwize.com/2015/09/30/migrating-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/">http://samwize.com/2015/09/30/migrating-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dgmstuart.github.io/blog/2016/01/22/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-3/">http://dgmstuart.github.io/blog/2016/01/22/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-3/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.justinrummel.com/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/">https://www.justinrummel.com/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I tried it &hellip; but I stopped before the end. It&rsquo;s kind of working, but fundamental features like category archives required too much Jekylling for me at the time. And themes are still an issue &hellip; I mean, stock theme uses a clean and simple gem based update workflow, but most other themes rely on a tricky git clone-merge update workflow.</p>

<h2>Plan B : Find a hosted blog engine for hackers</h2>

<p>I found quite a few options :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> Looks cool, but there is no simple migration tool, and I&rsquo;ve been burned by postero.us shutting down, I want to keep control on my content</li>
<li><a href="https://posthaven.com/">Posthaven</a> Having loved postero.us, this one seems cool, It&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;m not sure the guys are keeping the motivation to increase their feature list with their current business model</li>
<li><a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> Looked great, but too expensive for me (19$ per month)</li>
<li><a href="http://codrspace.com">Codrspace</a> This is a special blogging platform for coders, but it seems it has not been updated for a long time</li>
<li><a href="https://logdown.com/">LogDown</a> This also is a special blogging platform for hackers. It seemed great and had everything I was looking for &hellip; I was ready to spend the 50$ per year for it as it could save me a lot of hassle. Unfortunately, I could not find a way to forward the categories of a post as <a href="https://twitter.com/pbourgau">Twitter</a> hashtags as I&rsquo;ve been doing with Octopress and <a href="https://feedburner.google.com">Feedburner</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In the end, I was rather disappointed by the alternatives, even though I was ready to pay for them.</p>

<h2>Plan C : Fix the error in Octopress 2</h2>

<p>Eventually, the fix was rather easy. People had fixed it by patching mentos.py file in the pygments.rb gem to run Python 2 instead of the stock Python. That&rsquo;s not great because it means that I&rsquo;d have to redo the patch every time I updated my gems, or rebuilt my workspace. Here is what I added to my Vagrantfile instead :</p>

<p><code>
sudo apt-get -y install python2.7
sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python
</code>
<a href="https://github.com/philou/philou.github.com/commit/ae14c511b682295ed7fdcb3b1a818926f803dd3a">Here</a> is the commit on my Github repo.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m sticking with Octopress2 for the moment. Maybe I&rsquo;ll re-try to migrate to Octopress3 later on, when an official migration tool or <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">guide</a> is available. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m still dreaming of my perfect blogging platform :</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>Static HTML generation</li>
<li>Self or SAAS hosted</li>
<li>Great integration with social media and the web</li>
<li>Easy to maintain</li>
<li>Plugable themes</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m looking for my next side project at the moment, that could be a useful one ! Anyone interested ?</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/real-developers-ship/"/>
    <updated>2016-05-11T04:33:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/real-developers-ship</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a developer and you are not shipping, you&rsquo;re in the danger zone. I believe it&rsquo;s mostly your fault, and it&rsquo;s time to act.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-11-real-developers-ship/deliver.jpg" title="A delivery key on a keyboard" ></p>

<h2>Nothing new</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s been told before. Famous blogs have said the same thing :</p>

<ul>
<li>In Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=290121">Real Programmers ship</a> without any explanation, as if it meant it all.</li>
<li>In Coding Horror <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway/">Version 1 Sucks, But Ship It Anyway</a> Jeff Atwood stresses the benefits of shipping early.</li>
<li>In Coding Horror again <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/shipping-isnt-enough/">Shipping Is Not Enough</a> Jeff Atwood goes one step further and explains that we need to create software that is going to be used.</li>
<li>In his <a href="http://removingalldoubt.com/post/2006/09/19/Fatherly-Advice-To-New-Programmers.aspx">fatherly advice to new programmers</a> Chuck Jazdzewski&rsquo;s says &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get paid to program, you get paid to ship.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<h2>What does it really mean ?</h2>

<p>If you are not shipping, are you really developing something ? Maybe it&rsquo;s more some kind of research project, or maybe you are just there for learning ? <em>Real Developers know what they are in for.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because the quality is too bad, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve been developing poor quality software &hellip; <em>Real developers write quality software.</em> (BTW, shipping bug fixes is not shipping)</p>

<p>If you are not shipping because you don&rsquo;t have yet enough features, that&rsquo;s because your MVP is not small enough (despite the current Skateboard metaphor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgETWBKCRSQ">this</a> is not an MVP). <em>So Real developers follow lean (startup) principles.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because it&rsquo;s much work, that&rsquo;s because you did not automate delivery. <em>Real developers use continuous delivery.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because someone else said so, maybe it&rsquo;s time to convince her. <em>Real developers know how to deal with people.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because you are in a shitty environment &hellip; <em>Real developers work on their skills to be able to quit when needed.</em></p>

<h2>Shipping above all else</h2>

<p>My point is that every developer or organization containing developers should put shipping value as their absolute priority, and things should get a lot simpler.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[5 Books About Data Driven Lean Software Development]]></title>
    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-books-about-data-driven-lean-software-development/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-29T05:25:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-books-about-data-driven-lean-software-development</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In french, we say &ldquo;Le cordonnier est toujours le plus mal chaussé&rdquo; which I found an English equivalent in &ldquo;the shoemaker’s son always goes barefoot&rdquo;. I believe this is nowhere more true than in the software industry !</p>

<p>&ldquo;Software is eating the world&rdquo; they say. Software is now able to do things that only humans used to be. So why the hell are we driving our projects as if we were a horde of amateur hitch hikers ?</p>

<h2>What does it mean to be data driven ?</h2>

<p>Being data driven would allow us to answer questions such as :</p>

<ul>
<li>How much is the feature we delivered last week contributing to the bottom line ?</li>
<li>How much is the feature we are currently developing expected to contribute to the bottom line ?</li>
<li>What are the estimated cost <em>and value</em> of increasing our test coverage of 1% ?</li>
<li>What are the estimated interests and nominal amounts of our current technical debt ?</li>
<li>Which is the most valuable : improving our build system or building this new feature ?</li>
</ul>


<p>Most projects I&rsquo;ve worked in have absolutely no clue about the answers to these questions. The decision is left to experts, to the one with most influence, or simply to the developer, who can do how he thinks is best &hellip;</p>

<h2>The books</h2>

<p>Hopefully, some people are thinking differently, they believe it is possible to quantify all this, they even explain how !</p>

<p>Although this book is getting old, and is a bit outdated when compared to agile development practices, it provides real world examples of how scientific measurement can be applied to software product development.</p>

<h2>An opportunity</h2>

<p>Reading these books was a real eye opener for me. The software development world is plagued with cargo cult and supposed best practices. We follow advises, but most often without verifying if they actually work ! I believe that by applying the techniques in these books, we could create standard ways to measure the values of productivity, technical debt, quality, testing &hellip;</p>

<p>I see real opportunities to avoid a lot of useless argument between proponents of A and B, but also to communicate better with all stakeholders and finally, to reduce stress for all of us.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-long-can-your-inner-drive-last/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-25T06:41:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-long-can-your-inner-drive-last</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Any software project (job, startup or side project) will require some time before one can get real feedback from real users.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-02-25-how-long-can-your-inner-drive-last/exhausted-runner.jpg" title="An exhausted runner" ></p>

<h2>The hard truth</h2>

<p>Your inner drive will only last up to some point. Without feedback, your motivation will die, and this will kill your project.</p>

<h2>How to deal with it ?</h2>

<h3>Know it before you start</h3>

<p>From my own past experiences, I could find that my inner drive has usually disappeared after 2 years (I don&rsquo;t want a word about the time I actually wasted to discover this &hellip;). You too can try to estimate how long you can keep on without much feedback, go through your previous experiences to get an idea.</p>

<p>Once you have an idea of how long you can keep on without much feedback, you&rsquo;re in a much better place to decide to embark on a new project.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t drown in the code</h3>

<p>I once started a <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/rip-mes-courses-dot-fr/">side project</a> partly because I was fed up with the poor technologies I was asked to use at work. My project was some kind of salvation. The drawback of this situation is that I tended to dive into code way too early ! Building a real product takes time, and that&rsquo;s a sure way to get late feedback.</p>

<h3>Use Lean Startup techniques</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/UX-Lean-Startups-Experience-Research/dp/1449334911"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-02-25-how-long-can-your-inner-drive-last/ux-for-lean-startups.jpg" title="The cover of the book &lsquo;UX For Lean Startups&rsquo;" ></a></p>

<p><a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> is all about getting constant user feedback, even before having any user. I especially liked the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/UX-Lean-Startups-Experience-Research/dp/1449334911">UX for Lean Startups</a> that explains all the ways to get feedback from the cheapest (interviews) to the most expensive (HTML mockups) without actually coding anything</p>

<h3>Watch out for the Duke Nukem Forever syndrome</h3>

<p>Be very careful of endeavors that promise an Eldorado after long hard work that should last months or years. Products need to ship early with as fewest features, not late with many features. If you embark on such project, you&rsquo;re pretty likely to :</p>

<ul>
<li>burn out before the end</li>
<li>deliver something that is already outdated the day it goes live</li>
<li>never deliver anything</li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re already on such a project, I strongly suggest quitting.</p>

<h2>End word</h2>

<p>Maybe getting real feedback from real users takes time, but getting very early feedback from future users is almost always possible.</p>

<p>Keep going, get some feedback !</p>

    <updated>2015-12-31T12:24:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/great-developers-are-free</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For many reasons. But mostly because they are key to efficiently growing a software organization.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-12-31-great-developers-are-free/cat-codes-for-food.jpg" title="A funny picture sleeping on a keyboard, with the mention &lsquo;Will code for food&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>A tale of 2 teams</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at 2 software teams in the world of corporate finance.</p>

<h3>The junior in-house team</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/emploi/2013/12/07/09005-20131207ARTFIG00309-bruit-temperature-air8230-les-salaries-reserves-sur-l-open-space.php"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-12-31-great-developers-are-free/open-space.jpg" title="A big corporate open space" ></a></p>

<p>One is an in-house software development team in a large bank. The project already has a bad reputation among developers.The bank has difficulties to hire so the team is constituted of 10 rather junior developers. Unfortunately, without guidance and long term vision, the quality of the code suffers. It looks like an ad-hoc composition of various technolgies, glue code, and reinvented frameworks. The overall result is a barely good enough product that costs a small fortune in maintainance and support. The user experience is awful, which make it difficult to the the team leaders and the users to collaborate effectively. As a result of all this, the project is suffering from high turnover. Managing this project is really challenging &hellip; and kind of depressing.</p>

<h3>The experienced software team</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.personalized-software.ie/aboutus"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-12-31-great-developers-are-free/experienced-team.jpg" title="An experienced software team" ></a></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s imagine the same product developed at a software house. It&rsquo;s been on the market for a while now, but new features are regularly added to it at a good pace. The product is solid and the users are happy using it. The structure of the team is completely different : 5 developers, mainly experienced, coming from various backgrounds. As a result, the team builds on all their different expertises to build real competitive advantages. They tend to get into healthy debates about a lot of things, such as :</p>

<ul>
<li>Should we re-use or re-write ?</li>
<li>Is this gold plating or plain technical debt ?</li>
<li>Which technology should we use to build this ?</li>
</ul>


<p>In the end, that makes the product even better. The humane side of the team is also completely different. These experienced developers have all been exposed to the big picture during their careers, and they know things like :</p>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Business talk&rsquo; and so they can discuss product topics with the product managers</li>
<li>The best way to go through chores at work is to do them right now</li>
<li>Enough management, testing, ops to make the team self organized</li>
</ul>


<p>The single junior developer in the team tends to mimic this model, and has ease finding mentors, to teach him their trade and to give him career counsels.</p>

<p>As a result, the product and the team remain healthy, and keep providing benefits to all stakeholders.</p>

<h2>Benefits of experienced teams</h2>

<p>First, from a purely short term financial point of view, it&rsquo;s a no brainer ! Even if you pay experienced developers twice as much as juniors, the costs will still be on par. But the difference in created value is huge !</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s then have a look at the longer term, organizational aspect of things. Obviously, managing such teams requires a lot less work ! Both because of their size and because experienced developers tends to manage themselves very well &hellip; Promoting self-organized &amp; cross-functionnal teams is a great opportunity to reduce the management cost and friction, making the organization more reactive and cost efficient in the long run.</p>

<h2>What is an experienced developer ?</h2>

<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;ve worked with people that were experienced on paper, but not in practice. I <a href="http://www.jrothman.com/htp/interview/2004/12/whats-a-year-of-experience/">read</a> that repeating 10 times the same year of work only amounts to 1 year of experience.</p>

<p>If I was asked to give a definition, I&rsquo;d say that experienced developers have worked on different kind of systems (embeded, web, client, server &hellip;) using different technologies (Java, Ruby, C, Spring, Rails, Javascript &hellip;). Their experiences need not be professional, I&rsquo;ve seen a physics teacher that hacked himself into a great hacker through side projects and open source. Speaking of the subject, good developers always spent a lot of time learning, reading, doing side projects and contributing to open source. Some can be found in local user groups and online programming communities.</p>

<h2>So How do you get them ?</h2>

<p>I can only think of 3 obvious ways :</p>

<ul>
<li>train them</li>
<li>keep them</li>
<li>hire them</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure training them will not be an issue if you already have enough of them. So that brings us to the 2 other points.</p>

<p>Lot&rsquo;s of articles have been written about attracting and keeping the best developers. Some companies even made it <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html">their differentiating point</a>. Here are a few links :</p>

<ul>
<li>In his post <a href="http://avc.com/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky/">&ldquo;The Management Team&rdquo;</a> Joel Splosky details the inverted pyramid model</li>
<li>Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s (again) <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/DevelopmentAbstraction.html">Development Abstraction Layer</a> explains all the physical environment that makes programmers happy at work</li>
<li><a href="http://qz.com/169147/applications-have-doubled-to-the-company-that-discloses-its-salaries/">After disclosing employee salaries, Buffer was inundated with resumes</a> when <a href="http::/www.buffer.com">buffer.com</a> publicly disclosed <a href="https://open.buffer.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/">their salary formula</a>, the number of applications the company received doubled</li>
<li>Spotify organizes <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2013/02/15/organizing-a-hack-week/">Hack Weeks</a> where  the company stops for a while to invent new things</li>
<li>Google summarizes it &ldquo;Do Cool Things That Matters&rdquo; in their long advertises <a href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/">Life At Google</a></li>
</ul>


<p>These are just a few examples and are by no way the only things that motivate developers. To summarize, provide the best working conditions (careful, that not money), and communicate a lot about it.</p>

<h2>Hiring is too important to be left to HR</h2>

<p><a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/">Jurgen Appelo</a> said</p>

<blockquote><p>Management is too important to be left to managers.</p></blockquote>

<p>I guess the same thing can be said about hiring.</p>

<p>Engineers are absolutely required to take the main role when hiring other engineers. Companies that seriously want to have the best developers on board are spending substantial engineering time on hiring. Here are some well known examples :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/hiringprocess/">Google</a> is known to conduct around 9 interviews before hiring someone</li>
<li>In its <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf">Handbook for New Employee</a> Valve explicitly states that hiring is your most important role</li>
</ul>


<h2>Endword</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Tom_DeMarco">Tom DeMarco</a> said about quality, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451733851&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=peopleware">Peopleware</a> :</p>

<blockquote><p>Great developers are free, but only for those who are willing to pay for them</p></blockquote>
