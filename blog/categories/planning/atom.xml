<p>{% img center /imgs/2015-12-14-my-dream-lean-software-development-tool-lean-software-development-part-9/it-sucks.jpg A stamp that writes &ldquo;SUCKS&rdquo; %}</p>

<p>By writing <a href="/the-flow-book-summary-lean-software-development_part_1/">this series of posts</a>, I realized that they should help us to prioritize rather than just serving as a nice GUIs on top of a ticket database.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take the story of developer Joe as an example. Joe is working for Megacorp, where he makes a good living, but feels like a small cog in the machine. He has lost the thrill of programming &hellip; He&rsquo;s still staying informed about latest trends in software world, but his job involves aging technologies. He knows that if he wants to remain in the course, he has to change gears. One day, he decides to do something <em>now</em>, and starts a side project in the hope of someday making a living out of it.</p>

<p>He does not have a large amount of money to invest in his project, so he decides to bootstrap his product using <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a>. He reads and understands that there is a lot of different kind of activities to do if he wants to realize his dream : experiments, marketing, sales, design, coding &hellip;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he&rsquo;s so tired of programming boring stuff that he contracted the developer bias : he starves to code cool things again ! He knows the rest is important, he tries to do some of it, but he just doesn&rsquo;t realize how <em>much</em> needs to be done. So, without realising it, he wastes a lot of time coding something that people eventually don&rsquo;t buy. After 1 or 2 years of hard work, a working product but no users, he eventually quits, quite depressed &hellip;</p>

<p>I guess you don&rsquo;t want to be Joe ! I know you&rsquo;ll think it won&rsquo;t happen to you &hellip; believe me, it can, <a href="rip-mes-courses-dot-fr/">I learned it the hard way</a> !</p>

<p>Now suppose you had a tool that estimates the expected values of all different tasks :</p>

<ul>
<li>By applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo simulations</a> to probabilistic value and size ranges, it could compute which features we should work on first. As a side effect, this could give us some release date estimates for a feature, depending on its position in the backlog.</li>
<li>By having explicit experiment tasks with target value or size ranges, it could compute the value of information and prioritize experiments versus other tasks.</li>
<li>Crossing informations from IDEs, VCS, Quality Trackers and CIs, it could detect technical debt items (aka. productivity opportunities), compute their values in the long run, and prioritize them with other tasks.</li>
<li>If we found a way to integrate marketing, sales and design tasks, any kind of activity could be stored in the backlog, valued and prioritized.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is what the backlog could look like :</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2015-12-14-my-dream-lean-software-development-tool-lean-software-development-part-9/mockup.jpg A mockup of the backlog view of such a product %}</p>

<p>All different kind of activities (developments, marketing, experiments, refactorings) would fit in the backlog. The system would estimate the value of every task for Joe, advising him what to work on first. It would make it obvious just how much market experiments are important when starting ! With such a tool, he is a lot more likely to build his new life.</p>

<p>The good thing with such a tool is that it could be built by feeding itself. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">Eating its own dog&rsquo;s food</a> has always been the nice thing about writing software tools.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to know, what do you think of the idea ? Would you use such a tool ? Is it worth me spending my nights building it ?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There must be a way to know the real money value of <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;.</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2015-12-07-how-ill-measure-the-lean-startup-value-of-information-in-my-next-side-project-lean-software-development-part-8/knowledge-money.jpg A brain or some money ? %}</p>

<p>Lean Startup is about gathering &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; through experiments instead of building things. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450068976&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=lean+product+development">Flow book</a> suggests that the value of an information is its expected impact on the bottom line. So by combining both, there should be a way to compute a quantitative value for the knowledge.</p>

<p>The overall plan would be :</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a rough business plan, but assume that all that&rsquo;s in it has got 1 chance out of 10 of being right</li>
<li>Design experiments to precise the likelyhood of what&rsquo;s in the business plan</li>
<li>Compute the value of each experiment as the difference of the expected bottom line after and before running it (This should be possible if relying on the business plan for other parameters)</li>
<li>Work on the task with the highest expected value, be it an experiment, a development, a sales task, or whatever</li>
<li>Adapt you business plan with any new information</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
<li>If it becomes obvious that the expected final earnings are too low, pivot</li>
</ol>


<p>Flow explains that all the principles are pretty robust to bad inputs and errors. In short, the final estimations of earnings are still a lot better than without using any specific method. In the case of Lean Startup, it means that a false business plan is a good enough starting point.</p>

<h2>How to assess the likelyhood of a figure ?</h2>

<p>By default let&rsquo;s assume the value of a feature is somewhere between 0 and your highest estimate. As we&rsquo;ll go through experiments we&rsquo;ll be able to narrow this value range and have a more accurate estimate for the real value.</p>

<p>To keep things simple we could assume that the probability of value is uniformaly distributed within this range. From what I read in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449901015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=waltzing+with+bears">Waltzing With Bears</a>, here would be a more realistic probability distribution.</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2015-12-07-how-ill-measure-the-lean-startup-value-of-information-in-my-next-side-project-lean-software-development-part-8/Demarco-probability.png The curve of the probability of value according to DeMarco %}</p>

<h2>How to estimate the value of an experiment ?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into the details here, because the logic is exactly the same as with technical experiments (which <a href="/measure-the-business-value-of-your-spikes-and-take-high-payoff-risks-lean-software-development-part-4/">I already wrote about</a>)</p>

<p>Since then though, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449901015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=waltzing+with+bears">Waltzing With Bears</a> which presents a way of doing Monte Carlo simulations in order to estimate risks on your project. I guess the same thing could be used for value, which would save us from a lot of complex math.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449901015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=waltzing+with+bears">{% img center /imgs/2015-12-07-how-ill-measure-the-lean-startup-value-of-information-in-my-next-side-project-lean-software-development-part-8/waltzing-with-bears.jpg Cover of &lsquo;Waltzing With Bears&rsquo; %}</a></p>

<h2>When to stop doing experiments ?</h2>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t all this overkill ? One could argue that the point of Lean Startup should be to build just enough knowledge ! In fact, this value of information concept naturaly helps to find out when running the experiment is not worth it compared to actually doing the real thing.</p>

<p>BTW, a tool doing all this for your automaticaly would be great, wouldn&rsquo;t it ?</p>

<h2>What I&rsquo;ll do for my next bootstrap side project</h2>

<ol>
<li>Start with a target hourly earning rate.</li>
<li>Collect a list of projects I&rsquo;d be interested in.</li>
<li>Pick a project and write a business goal for it.</li>
<li>Assign likelyhoods and ranges on every figure in the business plan.</li>
<li>Design experiments to improve the figures.</li>
<li>Create tasks to actually build and sell the product.</li>
<li>Compute values for each of these tasks.</li>
<li>Work the most valueable first.</li>
<li>If the figures prove that I will not make my target wage with this project, I&rsquo;ll pivot, and restart from 2.</li>
<li>Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll repeat from 4.</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The sad truth :</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> metaphor does not help me to fix it.</p></blockquote>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2015-08-20-a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/debt.jpg &ldquo;A desperate man counting his debts&rdquo; %}</p>

<p>Here is my modest 2€ plan about how to try to get out of this.</p>

<h2>Why does the metaphor fall short ?</h2>

<p>The debt comparison effectively helps non programming people to understand that bad code costs money. Unfortunately, it does not tell you how much. As a consequence, deciding whether it&rsquo;s best to fix the technical debt or to live with it remains a gut feeling decision <del>(aka programmers want to stop the world and fix all of it while the product owner wants to live with it)</del>.</p>

<p>They are very good reason why we cannot measure how much the technical debt costs :</p>

<ul>
<li>It is purely subjective : bad code for someone might be good code for another. Even worse, as you become a better programmer, yesterday&rsquo;s master piece might become today&rsquo;s crap. More often, as a team gains insight on the domain, old code might suddenly appear completely wrong &hellip;</li>
<li>Tools such as Sonar only spot the a small part of the debt. The larger part (design, architecture and domain) remains invisible</li>
<li>Finally, non-remediation cost (the time wasted working on the bad code) is often overlooked and very difficult to measure : it depends on what you are going to work in the future !</li>
</ul>


<p>No surprise it&rsquo;s difficult to convince anyone else why fixing your debt is a good investment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dilbert.com">{% img center /imgs/2015-08-20-a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/dilbert.jpg &ldquo;A dilbert cartoon about a programmer killed by technical debt&rdquo; %}</a></p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>In the team, we usually try not to create debt in the first place. We have strong code conventions and working agreements. We are doing a lot of refactoring in order to keep our code base clean. But even with all this, debt creeps in :</p>

<ul>
<li>a pair worked on something and did not know that there is another part of the system that does roughly the same thing</li>
<li>we understand something new about the domain and some previously fine code becomes debt !</li>
<li>like all programmers, we are constantly in a hurry, and sometimes, we just let debt through</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>If the required refactoring is small enough, we just slip it inside a user story and do it on the fly. The real problem comes larger refactorings.</p>

<p>The strategy to deal with those is to get estimations of both the remediation and non-remediation costs. This way, the technical debt becomes an investment ! Invest X$ now and receive Y$ every month up to the end of the life of product. Provided you have the Cost Of Delay of the product, you can estimate the cost of delay of this individual technical debt fix. For example :</p>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s define the product horizon as its expected remaining life span at any moment</li>
<li>Suppose the product has a 5 years (60 months) horizon</li>
<li>Suppose the Cost Of Delay of the full product is 150K€/month</li>
<li>Suppose that the technical debt costs 10 days (0.5 month) to fix</li>
<li>Suppose that that once fixed, you&rsquo;ll save 2 days (0.1 month) of work per month</li>
<li>By doing the fix now, at the end of the 5 years, you would have saved : <em>(60 &ndash; 0.5) * 0.1 &ndash; 0.5 = 5.45 months</em></li>
<li>Using CoD, this ammounts to : <em>5.45 * 159K = 817.5K €</em></li>
<li>Dividing by the number of months, we finaly get the CoD for this technical debt fix : <em>817.5K / 60 = 13 625 €/month</em></li>
</ul>


<p>This can be compared to the CoD of other backlog items, allowing us to prioritize large refactorings as we would of any feature or story.</p>

<p>One nice thing about this is that it not only helps to know if a refactoring is cost effective, but also when is the best moment to do it. As the CoD of the refactoring is proportional to inverse of the product horizon, a premature refactoring for a startup product might become a real bargain after the product has settled as a market leader. Here are examples of possible product horizons :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Context </th>
<th> Horizon</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Startup </td>
<td> 6 months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 years old company </td>
<td> 3 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Market leading product </td>
<td> 10 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aging System </td>
<td> 5 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Legacy System </td>
<td> 2 years</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br/>


<p>Oh, and just one more thing &hellip; prioritizing technical debt fixes in your backlog will create some real time to focus on and only on refactoring, reducing task switching and saving even more time.</p>

<p>All this sounds great ! There&rsquo;s just one last little thing : how do we get estimations of both costs of the technical debt ?</p>

<h2>Idea 1 : Collective Estimations</h2>

<p>When I attended Donald Reinertsen&rsquo;s training, I asked him the question and he answered :</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;d gather the top programmers in a room and I&rsquo;d make them do an estimation of both costs.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I asked my team if they wanted to do the following :</p>

<ol>
<li>whenever you spot a large piece of debt, create a JIRA issue for it</li>
<li>at the end of your next sprint planning session, go through all your technical debt issues, and for each

<ol>
<li>estimate the remediation cost in story points</li>
<li>estimate the non-remediation cost on the coming sprint, taking the prioritized stories into account</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>using the ROI horizon for every issues, collectively decide which one to tackle and add them to the sprint backlog</li>
</ol>


<p>To keep the story short, it did not stick. I bet it was just too boring.</p>

<h2>Idea 2 : Technical Debt Code Annotations</h2>

<p>During a retrospective, we discussed marking technical debt directly in the code to decide when to fix it. I created 2 code annotations so that this can be done. Here is an example of some identified technical debt :</p>

<p>```java
public final class Transformers {</p>

<p>   private Transformers() {
   }</p>

<p>   @TechnicalDebt(storyPoints = 8, description =</p>

<pre><code> "We need to find a way to do all the ast rewriting before staring the analysis", wastes = {
 @Waste(date = "2015/05/14", hours = 16, summary =
   "For union, we lost quite some time identifying which transformers were not copying the full tree")})
</code></pre>

<p>   public static AstNode analyzeAst(AstNode ast) {</p>

<pre><code> ...
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The @TechnicalDebt annotation identifies areas of the code that could be improved.
The @Waste annotation is a way to log time wasted because of this bad code.</p>

<p>By comparing the time to fix the technical debt and the flow of extra work it incurs, we should be able to more easily justify and prioritize these in our backlog.</p>

<p>We are thinking of writing a sonar plugin to keep track of this technical debt right in our <a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">Sonar dashboard</a>. It would :</p>

<ul>
<li>create a technical debt item in sonar for every @TechnicalDebt annotation found in the code</li>
<li>link it with a mirror technical debt issue in JIRA</li>
<li>use the story points we entered in the annotation as remediation cost</li>
<li>extrapolate the non remediation cost by the sum of wasted hours registered during the last month</li>
</ul>


<p>We just started using those, and I cannot give enough feedback for the moment. I bet not enough @Waste items will be entered though &hellip; again, it might just be too boring</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">{% img center /imgs/2015-08-20-a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/sonar-sqale.jpg &ldquo;A screenshot of Sonar Qube Sqale technical debt plugin&rdquo; %}</a></p>

<h2>Idea 3 : Sonar and IDE Plugins</h2>

<p>If it&rsquo;s too boring to add @Waste annotations in the code, it might be easier to have an IDE plugin with 1 big button to register some time wasted on the local @TechnicalDebt zone.</p>

<p>Pushing things a bit further, it might even be possible to estimate non remediation cost by having a look at what files are read the more, what files are triggering the more test failures when changed, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s a long shot, we&rsquo;re definitely not there yet !</p>

<h2>Possible Improvements</h2>

<h3>The Mikado Method</h3>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;ve got these estimations or not, it&rsquo;s always a good practice to learn how to  use the <a href="https://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/the-mikado-method-in-under-a-minute/">mikado method</a>. It&rsquo;s great to split a refactoring into smaller part and spread them over many sprints.</p>

<p>The pill is easier to swallow for everyone, and it keeps the code releasable at any given time.</p>

<h3>Decision Rule</h3>

<p>Provided you have :</p>

<ul>
<li>Product CoD</li>
<li>Top Features CoD</li>
<li>Product horizon</li>
</ul>


<p>You could easily come up with a <a href="/you-dont-have-to-ask-your-boss-for-a-fast-build-lean-software-development-part-6/">decision rule</a> to help us prioritizing technical debt more quickly, without the need for a formal planning.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Making commitments to deliver software is always difficult. Whatever the margin you might take, it invariably seems wrong afterward &hellip;</p>

<p>Most Scrum, XP or Kanban litterature does not adress the issue, simply saying that commitment is not required, as long as you continuously deliver value (faster than your competition). That&rsquo;s kind of true, but sometimes you need commitments, for example if your customer is not yet ready to deploy your new software every friday worldwide &hellip;</p>

<p>So how can you do it while remaining agile ?</p>

<p>Grossly speaking, you have 2 options :</p>

<h2>Do it as usual</h2>

<p>Discuss with your experts, take some margin, do whatever voodoo you are used to. This will not be worse than it used to be. It might turn out better, thanks to your agile process, you should be able to deploy with a reduced the scope if needed.</p>

<h2>Use your agile process metrics</h2>

<h3>Let&rsquo;s estimate the time you&rsquo;ll need before the release</h3>

<ul>
<li>First, list all the stories you want it your release</li>
<li>Then estimate them with story points.</li>
<li>Now that you have the total number of story points you&rsquo;ll have to deliver before the release, apply a generic risk multiplier :</li>

<p><em>As explained in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411140759&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile+development">The Art of Agile Development</a> page 227, these numbers com from <a href="http://www.systemsguild.com/riskology/">DeMarco&rsquo;s Riskology</a> system. Using XP practices means fixing all bugs at all iteration, sticking rigorously to DONE-DONE, and having a stable velocity over iterations.</em></p>

<p>This factor will account for unavoidable scope creep and wrong estimations.
* Use you iteration velocity to know how many sprints you&rsquo;ll need to finish.</p>

<h4>For example :</h4>

<p>Suppose you have 45 stories that account for a total of 152 story points, and that your velocity is 23 story points per iteration. You need to do a commitment, but hopefully, you are applying all the XP practices. So you can compute :</p>

<blockquote><p>Number of sprints = 152*1.8/23 = 12 sprints, (24 weeks, or about 5.5 months)</p></blockquote>

<h3>What about unknown risks ?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, using just the previous, you might miss some unavoidable important tasks you&rsquo;ll need to do before you can release. Think about monitoring tools and stress testing, when did your product owner prioritize these ? These are risk management activities that need to be added to your backlog in the first place. Here is how to list most of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do a full team brainstorming about anything that could possibly go bad for your project</li>
<li>For every item discovered, estimate

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s probability of occurrence (low, medium, high)</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s consequences (delay, cost, cancellation of the project)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For every item, decide whether to

<ul>
<li>avoid it : you have to find a way to make sure this will not happen</li>
<li>contain it : you&rsquo;ll deal with the risk when it occurs</li>
<li>mitigate it : you have to find a way to reduce it&rsquo;s impact</li>
<li>ignore it : don&rsquo;t bother with unlikely risks of no importance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, create stories to match your risk management decisions. These might be :

<ul>
<li>Monitoring systems helps to contain a risk</li>
<li>Logging helps to mitigate a risk</li>
<li>An automated scaling in script for situations of high demand helps both mitigate and contain the risk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simply add these stories to your backlog, and repeat the previous section. You can now make your commitment</li>
</ul>


<h2>Afterthoughts</h2>

<p>Contrary to the widespread belief, agile practices and metrics actually helps to make commitments.</p>

<p>It would be better if we had project specific statistics instead of generic risk multipliers. It&rsquo;s a shame that task tracking tools (JIRA &amp; friends) still don&rsquo;t help us with this.</p>

<p>We should keep in mind though, that estimating all your backlog in advance takes some time and is actually some kind of waste. If possible, just sticking to build (and sell) the thing that is the most useful now is more simple (<a href="http://vimeo.com/75196281">this guy calls it drunken stumble</a>).</p>
