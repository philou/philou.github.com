    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the fourth and last post in a <a href="/blog/categories/agile-transformations-fail-series/">series about making large organizations more agile</a>. I encourage you to <a href="/why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-1-the-situation/">start with the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>In the previous posts, I presented why large scale &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; transformation usually fail. Part of the solution is about giving people the time to learn and a safe environment. That&rsquo;s not enough though.</p>

<h2>Provide the data</h2>

<p>I explained how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives">Management by Objectives</a> harms experimentation. I presented alternatives like Salary Formula, Badge Based Compensation and Merit Money.</p>

<p>An interesting commonality between these compensation practices is that they are transparent. When all this is public, people know what to do if they want to increase their income. For example : get a badge by learning something new, or collaborate with others to get monkey money. That&rsquo;s great, but they should also know how to increase the profits to get a bigger cake for everyone !</p>

<p>Management By Objectives is not only about compensation. It also cascades business objectives all the way down to everyone in the company. If we get rid of MBO, people still need to know what is important.</p>

<p>Let me introduce Objectives and Key Results, aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKRs</a>. Intel invented OKRs. Nowadays, among many other companies, Google is famous for using them.</p>

<p><a href="http://upraise.io/blog/difference-mbo-okr/"><img src="../imgs/2018-01-11-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-4-transparency/MBO_OKR.jpg" alt="A visual comparision of MBO and OKRs" /></a></p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ OKRs have nothing to do with compensation !</p></blockquote>

<p>OKRs match this experimentation mindset. OKR objectives should be ambitious, with room for overachievement. OKRs also provide Key Results, which let people measure how well they are doing ! As OKRs are public, teams get a full understanding of the context of their actions.</p>

<p>To max out the value of OKRs, we should make as much data public as possible. Financial figures can really help teams to know if they are doing a good job.</p>

<p>The end result is that teams can take informed decisions. They can measure the impact of their work at their scale, but also on the full organization.</p>

<h2>Compelling mission</h2>

<p>A last good point of OKRs is that they make very good higher level backlog items. Both <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/march/stories-versus-themes-versus-epics">Team Epics</a> and full products can be OKRs. Even the company&rsquo;s mission can be an OKR. Check Toyota&rsquo;s mission, for example, &ldquo;Better cars for more people&rdquo;. This provides invaluable guidance for everyone to take day to day decisions.</p>

<p>In fact, a clear and motivating company mission statement is not only good but mandatory. Without it, people will go in all direction, resulting in very slow progress. It&rsquo;s an absolute pre-requisite for self organization to work. This is particularly a challenge for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business">business-to-business</a> companies. One symptom is when developers succumb to <a href="https://dev.to/tra/expert-resum-driven-development">Resume Driven Development</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Self organization does not work without a clear and compelling mission.</p></blockquote>

<h2>To summarize</h2>

<p>Organization&rsquo;s initiatives to become agile fast are doomed. They can at best expect small productivity and visibility improvements.</p>

<p>The benefits of being agile include lasting continuous improvement and business resiliency. Unfortunately, this cannot happen in a day. The road starts with the following :</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a safe environment by getting the compensation issues out of the picture</li>
<li>Providing a clear goal and all the data people need to take informed decisions</li>
<li>Finally, leave the time for the people to learn</li>
</ul>


<p>I discovered another fun fact while looking for references. People from lean manufacturing have been <a href="http://blog.maskell.com/?p=2306">arguing the same thing</a> for decade ! The good news though, is that we ripe improvements all along the way !</p>

<p>This was the last post of a series about making large organizations more agile. Next week, I&rsquo;ll present an idea to apply the <a href="https://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/">Mikado Method</a> to refactor organizations one step at a time !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the third post in a <a href="/blog/categories/agile-transformations-fail-series/">series about making large organizations more agile</a>. I encourage you to <a href="/why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-1-the-situation/">start with the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s summarize the previous posts. Large scale &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; transformation programs usually fall short of their promise. One reason is that leaders forget to provide a safe context to learn.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-01-11-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-3-what-to-do/donkey-carrot-stick.jpg" alt="A kid trying to drive a donkey with a carrot and a stick" /></p>

<h2>What should we do ?</h2>

<p>First, we should take the time ! Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day. The road to an agile organization is a never ending path. We should also remember what we are after :</p>

<ul>
<li>Super fast adaptation to business changes through massive decentralization</li>
<li>Low process overhead thanks to people&rsquo;s buy-in</li>
<li>Continuous innovation in both products and organization, relying on everyone&rsquo;s creativity</li>
</ul>


<p>This is far more ambitious than a mere 5% productivity increase !</p>

<h2>Be patient for people to learn</h2>

<p>The goal is for people to be able to take bigger decisions on the spot. No one can learn this in a few hours. All over the company, people will have to improve their problem solving skills. They might also need to learn how to do root cause analysis. They&rsquo;ll need to take into account the point of views of other people in the organization. Some will need to beef up their communication skills as well. All will need to master new collaboration practices to stay up to date with what is going on.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ An organization cannot be agile if all decisions have to go up and down the management ladder.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot, and it takes time. The visible part of the iceberg, the collaboration practices, can be setup in a few weeks. But it won&rsquo;t yield much until the people are bold enough to take decisions by themselves.</p>

<p>First, I need to have a word about the workload in this section. If people are <a href="http://barryoreilly.com/2017/05/31/busy-to-death/">Busy to Death</a>, They won&rsquo;t have the time to learn. They won&rsquo;t even have the mood to think. Again, lasting productivity goes through sustainable pace. Slack time or a 20% policy are very good investments here !</p>

<p>Communication skills alone take months or years to improve. A communication training campaign can help to make the company ready to be more agile. In a previous team, new joiners used to attend a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">Non-Violent Communication</a> training. Being transparent a constructive is a foundation of an agile organization.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1515736081&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=five+dysfunctions+of+a+team"><img src="../imgs/2018-01-11-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-3-what-to-do/5-dysfunctions-of-a-team.jpg" alt="Pyramid of the 5 dysfunctions of a team book&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, root cause analysis and problem solving skills take practice to get around. Some organizations, used to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick">carrots and sticks</a>, have been avoiding this for years ! Good coaches can teach this to teams. People first need to learn that it&rsquo;s OK to look into problems and to experiment solutions though. That&rsquo;s where a safe environment helps.</p>

<h2>The Safe environment enhancer</h2>

<p>If people remain afraid to fail, they won&rsquo;t do enough experiments. As a result, they&rsquo;ll learn slower. They&rsquo;ll also keep delegating more decisions ! The organization won&rsquo;t become very agile. Sure, leaders will get small productivity and predictability improvements. Unfortunately, exclusive focus on these puts innovation in danger.</p>

<p>People should have the means to experiment. By far the greatest experimentation killer is carrots and stick management. If people live in fear of losing their job, we have no chance of becoming more agile.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Encouraging experimentation while sticking to compensation by objectives is schizophrenic.</p></blockquote>

<p>The situation is only slightly better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives">management by objectives</a>. One of the reason is that as people start to expect their bonus, they also start to fear not having it next year ! We&rsquo;re back at the fear problem. There&rsquo;s a more direct issue with MBO though. A good experiment should be ambitious and have a high likelihood of failure. Unfortunately, people will negotiate unambitious objectives, to secure their bonus. In the end, people do far too few bold experiments and don&rsquo;t raise problems to safeguard their bonuses. Eventually, both people and the organization fail to learn.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Punished-Rewards-Trouble-Incentive-Praise/dp/0618001816"><img src="../imgs/2018-01-11-why-agile-transformations-usually-dont-work-part-3-what-to-do/punished-by-rewards.jpg" alt="Cover of the book &quot;Punished by rewards&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>Instead of using MBO, we need to find a different way to deal with compensation. The management 3.0 literature has plenty of ideas for that. For example :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://management30.com/practice/salary-formula/">Salary formula</a>. Some companies, like <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> use a <a href="https://buffer.com/salary">transparent formula</a> to compute everyone&rsquo;s compensation. This base salary is independent from any subjective performance evaluation. On top <a href="https://open.buffer.com/transparent-pay-revolution/">boosting motivation</a>, it provides plenty of room for experimentation.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><a href="https://qz.com/169147/applications-have-doubled-to-the-company-that-discloses-its-salaries/">After disclosing employee salaries, Buffer was inundated with resumes</a></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.holacracy.org/badge-based-compensation-app/">Badge-based compensation</a>. Holocracy describes how to take valuable skills into account in a salary formula. To get a badge on a topic, you need to be recognized by the people who already own this badge. Examples of badges can be &ldquo;UX Expert&rdquo; or &ldquo;Senior Software Engineer&rdquo;.</li>
<li><a href="https://management30.com/practice/merit-money/">Merit money</a>. Company profits redistribution to employees should be both motivating and fair. Instead of typical yearly bonuses, merit money is a crowd-sourced money allocation scheme. Everyone regularly receives a fixed amount of monkey money. You should give some back to a colleague who helped you. You could also give some to acknowledge someone else&rsquo;s great job. Every month a lottery is played to know if employees should receive their share of profits. If so, everyone gets his share in proportion with the monkey money they received. Otherwise, profits accumulate until the next lottery.</li>
</ul>


<p>We could worry that dropping MBO will drop people&rsquo;s motivation as well. It turns out it&rsquo;s the exact opposite ! Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFlvor6ZHdY">this talk</a> by Daniel Pinks to understand how bonuses kill motivation.</p>
