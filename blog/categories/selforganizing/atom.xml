    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For an organization, there&rsquo;s something schizophrenic about valuing team work, wanting agility but sticking to individual objectives and assessments.</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2016-03-30-how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/schizophrenic-smiley.jpg A schizophrenic :(: smiley %}</p>

<p>As highlighted in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Built-Last-Successful-Visionary-Essentials/dp/0060516402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459922545&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=build+to+last">Build To Last</a> genuine company values must permeate all aspects of the organization. Being agile also means putting teamwork first and that is quite incompatible with typical individual management by objectives and bonuses.</p>

<p>This is nothing new, many have already written about the subject</p>

<ul>
<li>Joel Spolsky : <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000070.html">Incentive Pay Considered Harmful</a></li>
<li>Daniel Pink : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459665370&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=drive+daniel+pink">Drive : The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</a></li>
<li>Alfie Kohn : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punished-Rewards-Trouble-Incentive-Praise/dp/0618001816/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459665424&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=punished+by+rewards">Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A&rsquo;s, Praise, and Other Bribes</a></li>
<li>Jurgen Appelo : <a href="http://noop.nl/2013/01/the-bonus-system.html">The Bonus System</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The problem is you usually don&rsquo;t have the choice ! Whether your team wants to or not, the chances are that your company already has a mandatory individual bonus scheme in place.</p>

<h2>Our delegation initiative</h2>

<p>As you might remember if you read my <a href="/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/">previous articles</a>, our team decided to move to more self organization. After identifying the end of year evaluation as something that could be further delegated, we embarked on brainstorming sessions about how to do it.</p>

<p>We discussed quite some options during our workshops. Things like :</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the goal of the annual evaluation ?</li>
<li>Should some people have a central role in the process ?</li>
<li>Should we encourage efforts or results ?</li>
<li>Should evaluations be public or private ?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s at stack at the annual evaluation ?</li>
<li>Should individual learning plans be part of the evaluation ?</li>
</ul>


<h2>What we came up with</h2>

<p>As a guiding principle, we agreed to value efforts rather than results. Sometimes, results are independent of efforts, and through efforts, it is always possible to get the best of any situation, even if the best is not a good result in itself.</p>

<h3>Throughout the year</h3>

<p>We are all sharing the same team objectives :</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;the team finishes the prioritized epics&rdquo; : we do regular epics prioritization sessions with our product owner and add the main epics to everyone&rsquo;s objectives</li>
<li>&ldquo;work on the same subject as the whole team&rdquo; : we have an overspecialization matrix that uses correlation to make sure that everyone touches the same parts of the system as the rest of the team</li>
</ul>


<p>Every 2 months, we are doing <a href="/feedback-on-360-degrees-feedback-session/">360° feedback sessions</a>, for everyone to give continuous feedback to others.</p>

<p>Optionally, we setup <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/intrinsic-motivation/kudo-box/">Kudo boxes</a> to give and receive thanks from others.</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2016-03-30-how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/kudo.jpg A kudo card %}</p>

<h3>At the end of the year</h3>

<p>When the time of the official end of year evaluation comes, we do 360°, 1 to 1 rating on the following topics.</p>

<ul>
<li> commitment &amp; courage (doing not so fun work, find difficult compromises, say the truth, strive for quality work)</li>
<li> helping others (giving a training, providing coaching, help others, do some evangelization)</li>
<li> self improvement (taking feedback into account, improve technical skills, work on soft skills)</li>
<li> team player (build friendly environment, contribute to team improvement, positive attitude, use a non violent communication)</li>
</ul>


<p>Grades are signed, and anyone can ask someone else for a discussion about his grades.</p>

<p>Overall, everyone gets an average grade, which we use to suggest a company grade (below, achieved, exceeded) to the HR system. It then gets homogenized with the rest of the company, but this is then out of our control.</p>

<p>One thing that made this possible is also that after taking a close look at the company grade system, we saw that not so much was at stake &hellip; Provided we make sure everyone has what it takes to do the job, anyone can get an achieved evaluation by doing enough efforts. Getting an exceeded is like a bonus for a particular good year.</p>

<h2>Last word</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure we could make this more simple in an environment with more end to end feedback (start-up or pizza teams) but we feel that our current alternative is a lot better than having the manager deciding everything on his own.</p>

    <updated>2016-03-21T21:05:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/make-hiring-everyones-business</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let me tell you a typical hiring story. A bit more than 10 years ago, I was contractor at a bank on a C++ front office application. The system had initially been well engineer, but it had been <del>stuffed together</del> merged with another system that had a completely different architecture. Ha, and there were no automated tests. As you&rsquo;d guess, we had quite our dose of bugs, and maintaining this application was not easy.</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2016-03-21-make-hiring-everyones-business/now-hiring.jpg A &lsquo;Now Hiring&rsquo; sign %}</p>

<p>The manager wanted to hire a C++ programmer to beef up the team. Along with the division&rsquo;s architect he was conducting interviews to find just that guy. A few weeks later, he found a known C++ &amp; Windows local expert. A few weeks later, the team unanimously declared that we could not work with him because he was both pretentious and incompetent.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure every developer already witnessed a similar story.</p>

<h2>Managers do the hiring</h2>

<p>This is the usual practice. The motivation is that managers have more experience so they should be better at it, and also that it alleviates developers from non-programming work. As we saw in the introduction story, there are issues with this approach too :</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s pretty bad for the team &lsquo;fit&rsquo; : there is no team building here. You often end up with a collection of individual working at the same place rather than with a real team.</li>
<li>during these interviews, the candidate only interacts with a particular type of profiles, who can tell how he&rsquo;ll be doing with more junior team members for example ?</li>
<li>as usual, this administrative work removes some programming from the manager&rsquo;s time. That&rsquo;s often not a good bargain</li>
<li>it decreases the team sense of control, as it is being &lsquo;forced&rsquo; to work with someone they did not choose. This makes it harder for them to take responsibility of what they are trying to achieve.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How we self organized hiring</h2>

<p>As I already explained in a <a href="/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/">previous post</a> we engaged in various self delegation initiative by doing a <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board</a>. During this meeting, we identified hiring as something that could be self delegated.</p>

<p>In order to fix that, we started a workshop for 1 hour per day with a sub group of the team. We started with a brainstorming, then we voted, and finally presented our proposition to the rest of the team, which actually validated it. The whole thing lasted for one week (5 hours).</p>

<p><a href="http://dilbert.com">{% img center /imgs/2016-03-21-make-hiring-everyones-business/dilbert.jpg A Dilbert cartoon about hiring based on internet profile %}</a></p>

<h2>What we decided for hiring</h2>

<p>Here is the process we have decided to follow to handle hiring team members</p>

<ol>
<li>First, everyone in the team is responsible to speak up when he thinks we need to hire someone, during our retrospectives for example</li>
<li>To handle new applications, we have prepared an online interview. It contains open questions and online coding exercises, on <a href="http://www.cyber-dojo.org/">cyber-dojo</a>, which allows us to track all the candidates iterations</li>
<li>We do a round robin to find out who will follow the candidate through the hiring process. This means taking notes, organizing interviews, keeping the rest of the team up to date.</li>
<li>When a candidate passes the online interview, we will receive him for an technical and general interview with 2 people from the team.</li>
<li>All the team will then meet the candidate for a coffee break, in order to know if he will fit in the team</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll then play the <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/6053596147744768/">Google hiring committee</a> until we reach a consensus</li>
<li>When in doubt, we&rsquo;ll do extra interviews, and repeat</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s just what we came up with, if you start this road, you might well come up with a very different process.</p>

<h2>One more thing</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to have a selective hiring, but you&rsquo;ll also need to improve the input of the hiring pipeline, but that&rsquo;s <a href="/great-developers-are-free/">another story</a> &hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We don&rsquo;t have an official scrum master in our team anymore. We now have 7 ! A different team member assumes the full scrum master role at every sprint.</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2016-03-15-scrum-teams-do-not-need-a-scrum-master/round-robin.jpg A fat round robin bird %}</p>

<h2>Why did we switch to Scrum Master round robin ?</h2>

<p>It all started with our <a href="https://management30.com/product/delegation-poker/">delegation poker</a> (see <a href="/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/">previous post</a>). We noticed that there were still quite some activities that I (the manager) was the only one to do. We hoped that by sharing these activities throughout the team, we would :</p>

<ul>
<li>increase everyone&rsquo;s motivation by showing a bigger picture</li>
<li>leave me more time for programming</li>
<li>learn new skills to everyone</li>
</ul>


<h2>How did we do it ?</h2>

<p>Before our <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board meeting</a>, we had prepared all the activities we are regularly doing. We found quite a few recurrent non programming tasks that traditionally eschewed to the team lead (me in that case). The initial plan was to find ways to delegate these activities to the team during the meeting, but it would have took way too much time.</p>

<p>Having identified all these activities, I individually suggested at everyone in the team to do a round robin scrum master role, which would handle all these activities for a sprint. I was happily surprise by the quasi complete buy-in from all the team. Before I announced it to the team, I did 2 things :</p>

<h3>List all the activities of the scrum master.</h3>

<p>Here is a subset :</p>

<ul>
<li>attend other teams meetings</li>
<li>make sure there are enough workable stories for the next planning session with the product owner</li>
<li>prepare and animate a retrospective</li>
<li>animate the demo</li>
</ul>


<h3>Make this more fun !</h3>

<script async src="http://philippe.bourgau.net//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I bought totems for the scrum master. The team chose to keep Yoda in Paris and send Darth Vador in <a href="https://twitter.com/ahmadatwi">Ahmad</a> suitcase back in Beirut.</p>

<h2>What did we get ?</h2>

<p>After a few sprints of this, the feedback I got is that people like the increased involvement in the big picture (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458076848&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=daniel+pink+drive">Daniel Pink told us that already</a>). On my part, it allowed to increase my programming time to nearly 7 uninterrupted days per sprint (10 days). I&rsquo;m quite happy with this ! As for the third goal, learning new skills, I guess we&rsquo;ll need a bit more time to figure this out.</p>

    <updated>2016-03-12T06:35:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most companies don&rsquo;t have <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/performance-management/">unlimited vacations</a>. Most likely, if you are an employee, your days off need to be validated by your boss. If you are like me, this feels like pulling teeth &hellip; Every time I have to ask for a day off, I feel like a kid asking for an extra candy</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not the only issue with how we traditionally deal with vacations :</p>

<ul>
<li>The boss has to make sure that there are always enough people at the office to handle emergencies</li>
<li>If the boss is himself away, getting a day off at the last moment becomes difficult</li>
</ul>


<h2>Our Delegation Board</h2>

<p>Our team at work is already rather agile : we&rsquo;re using a blend of XP and Scrumban, we follow solid engineering practices and we are always trying to improve to deliver more value to our users. After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Management-3-0-Developers-Developing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321712471/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457988177&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=management+3.0">Management 3.0</a> and <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/">Management Workouts</a> I was convinced that I needed to move the team towards even more self organization.</p>

<p>We started by doing <a href="https://management30.com/product/delegation-poker/">delegation poker</a>, we created a <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board</a>, and set out to move all cards we could to the right side of the board.</p>

<p><a href="/imgs/2016-03-12-stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/delegation-board-large.jpg">{% img center /imgs/2016-03-12-stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/delegation-board.jpg Our trello delegation board %}</a></p>

<p>We spotted the following topics that could be more self organized</p>

<ul>
<li>vacations</li>
<li>hiring</li>
<li>business objectives and end of year evaluations</li>
<li>various recurring scrum related activities</li>
<li>self development objectives</li>
</ul>


<h2>Vacations</h2>

<p>We decided to tackle vacations first, because it seemed easy. We did a quick brainstorming, and here is what we came up with :</p>

<ul>
<li>We cannot change the company policy, so I&rsquo;ll still have to officially validate everyone&rsquo;s vacations in the system but &hellip;</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll validate anything asked !</li>
<li>Our internal system allows to check the other team member&rsquo;s vacations, so everyone in the team is responsible to check that there will always be at least 2 people at work before taking a day off</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s been 6 months, and it&rsquo;s been working like a charm. I think it made everything simpler once we had a clear rule about when vacations were OK or not.</p>

    <updated>2016-02-17T06:40:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/recipes-for-an-agile-workspace</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, start-ups and tech companies seem to be competing for the most beautiful offices in order to attract top talents.</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2016-02-17-recipes-for-an-agile-workspace/open-space.jpg A nice modern and beautiful co-working space %}</p>

<p>Unfortunately, sometimes, it&rsquo;s just the good old office in disguise. At the opposite, some teams or companies actually think and decide how to organize their offices. For example, here is what <a href="https://twitter.com/kentbeck">Kent Beck</a> says about office setup in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456177035&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=extreme+programming+embrace+change">XP embrace change</a></p>

<blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t have a reasonable place to work, your project won&rsquo;t be successful. The difference
between a good space for the team and a bad space for the team is immediate and dramatic.</p></blockquote>

<p>Joel Spolsky has been blogging a lot about the office setups at <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BionicOffice.html">FogBugz</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BionicOffice.html">{% img center /imgs/2016-02-17-recipes-for-an-agile-workspace/fog-bugz.jpg The beautiful FogBugz office %}</a></p>

<p>While defining its agile culture, <a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/JoakimSunden/agile-at-spotify">Spotify too designed custom offices</a></p>

<p><a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/JoakimSunden/agile-at-spotify">{% img center /imgs/2016-02-17-recipes-for-an-agile-workspace/spotify.jpg Spotify offices %}</a></p>

<h2>How does it work ?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s review a few office design practices to understand how they work :</p>

<h3>The team room or space</h3>

<p>Having a delimited room helps to build a real team. First, by isolating from noises, it helps the team to focus on its work and current topics. Second, by providing a visual barrier to cross before anyone can disturb the team. Finally, it allows the team to organize its own visual management.</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2016-02-17-recipes-for-an-agile-workspace/spotify-team-room.jpg Team private work place at spotify %}</p>

<h3>Private team gathering area</h3>

<p>An area where the team (and only the team) can meet at any time is great to do on the spot meetings (without the hassle of finding a room). This area should be comfortable and provide a relaxed and creative atmosphere (which is very important to conduct efficient retrospectives). It can also be used to take breaks and lunches, fostering team spirit again.</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2016-02-17-recipes-for-an-agile-workspace/spotify-gathering-area.jpg Team gathering area with writable walls and a wall screen at spotify %}</p>

<h3>Writable walls</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy to cover the walls with whiteboard stickers so that there is plenty of room for discussing design and otherwise keeping important things visible for everyone.</p>

<h3>Laptops, Wifi and movable desks</h3>

<p>Lean manufacturing favors simple, versatile and configurable machines over powerful specialised ones, which are often pretty long to setup. In software, we don&rsquo;t rely on machines as much as factories do, but there might be something to take here. Using laptops, a good Wifi and movable desks, it is pretty easy to reconfigure your office as it best fits the team at a particular moment. This way a team can easily adapt to personal preferences and turnover.</p>

<h3>Wall screens</h3>

<p>Agile and Lean thinkings both heavily use visual management. Having a lot of wall screens dedicated to displaying team relevant information in the team space brings a lot of value. To get the maximum benefit, these wall screens should be fully configurable and movable by the team.</p>

<p>{% img center /imgs/2016-02-17-recipes-for-an-agile-workspace/wall-screens.jpg Our own wall screens at work %}</p>

<h3>Team budget</h3>

<p>Eventually, in order to make sure the team can always work as efficiently as possible, it should have some money to spend for its workspace. It could be used to buy any of the upper, but also anything else that might help the team at a particular point in time. Without such a budget, teams have to make a request to the office department to get anything, often to no avail, or with extra long delays.</p>

<h2>Distributed teams</h2>

<p>Distributed teams bring their own challenges &hellip; and workplaces needs.</p>

<h3>Remote team space</h3>

<p>If your team is split between 2 places (as our team is at <a href="http://www.murex.com">Murex</a>) then obviously, each site should have its own delimited space, with its own gathering area.</p>

<h3>Constant visio connection</h3>

<p>Connecting gathering areas through visio is a great way to build the distributed team. It prevents loosing time when a meeting is required. It also builds the team by showing what&rsquo;s happening on the other side and by making it possible to take distributed lunches and breaks !</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/distributed-team-agile">{% img center /imgs/2016-02-17-recipes-for-an-agile-workspace/distributed-lunch.jpg A team sharing food remotely between offices %}</a></p>

<h3>Distributed whiteboards</h3>

<p>I never had the chance to work with one of these, but I often missed a whiteboard when working remotely &hellip; Any input on this subject would be welcome !</p>

<h2>Lego offices</h2>

<p>Here is another extract from Kent Beck&rsquo;s &ldquo;XP Embrace Change&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>The courage value finds its expression in the XP attitude toward facilities. If the corporate attitude
toward facilities is at odds with the team&rsquo;s attitude, the team wins. If the computers are in the
wrong place, they are moved. If the partitions are in the way, they are taken down. If the lights are
too bright, they are taken out. If the phones are too loud, one day, mysteriously, they are all found
to have cotton stuffed in the bells.</p></blockquote>

<p>Improving the office is a cheap way to make a software organization more efficient. For another reference, here is what Tom DeMarco &amp; Tim Lister wrote in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321934113/ref=s9_simh_gw_g14_i3_r?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-1&amp;pf_rd_r=1K2KEWBRQK6F1R26D5D2&amp;pf_rd_t=36701&amp;pf_rd_p=2079475242&amp;pf_rd_i=desktop">Peopleware</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Police-mentality planners design workplaces the way they would design prisons: optimized for containment at minimal cost. We have unthinkingly yielded to them on the subject of workplace
design, yet for most organizations with productivity problems, there is no more fruitful area for improvement than the workplace. As long as workers are crowded into noisy, sterile, disruptive space, it&rsquo;s not worth improving anything but the <strong>workplace</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Instead of designing offices, furniture departments in companies could provide a constant stock of building blocks for office building. Teams could use a workplace budget to build the workspace that suits them most. A good Wifi, laptops, enough floor power plugs, extra screens, movable tables, movable walls and easy to fix wall monitors are all things that would make this possible.</p>
