    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/">previous post</a> I explained how <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Immutable Value Objects</a> help us to avoid mocks. In this post, I&rsquo;ll illustrate this in practice with real code.</p>

<p>This is the third post on a <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">series about how to avoid mocks</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, you can start reading the full story <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-04-17-immutable-value-objects-vs-mocks-fizz-buzz/immutable-fizz-buzz.jpg" alt="A drawing &quot;FIZZ BUZZ&quot; rock fallen and sealed in the ground" /></p>

<h2>Fizz Buzz Example</h2>

<p>As a simple example, I&rsquo;ll go through the classic <a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/">Fizz Buzz</a>. I&rsquo;ve implemented and tested it with and without immutable value objects. Please keep in mind that this is a toy example, where problems are obvious and easily fixed. I try to highlight at small scale the same problems that get hidden by the complexity of a large scale program.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a typical FizzBuzz implementation.</p>

<p>```ruby
1.upto(100) do |i|
  if (i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>STDOUT.puts("FizzBuzz\n")
</code></pre>

<p>  elsif (i%3 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>STDOUT.puts("Fizz\n")
</code></pre>

<p>  elsif (i%5 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>STDOUT.puts("Buzz\n")
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>STDOUT.puts("#{i}\n")
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Suppose you need to add some tests around the code. The most straightforward way is to mock <code>STDOUT</code> :</p>

<p>```ruby
require &lsquo;rspec&rsquo;</p>

<p>def fizzBuzz(max, out)
  1.upto(max) do |i|</p>

<pre><code>if (i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0)
  out.puts("FizzBuzz\n")
elsif (i%3 == 0)
  out.puts("Fizz\n")
elsif (i%5 == 0)
  out.puts("Buzz\n")
else
  out.puts("#{i}\n")
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h1>main</h1>

<p>fizzBuzz(100,STDOUT)</p>

<p>describe &lsquo;Mockist Fizz Buzz&rsquo; do</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print numbers, fizz and buzz&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>out = double("out")
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("1\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("2\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Fizz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("4\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Buzz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Fizz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("7\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("8\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Fizz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Buzz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("11\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Fizz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("13\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("14\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("FizzBuzz\n").ordered

fizzBuzz(15, out)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are a few problems with this code :</p>

<ul>
<li>With nested logic and complicated mock setup, both code and tests aren&rsquo;t very readable</li>
<li>They both seem to violate the single responsibility principle as well</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s depending on a mutable output. Within a larger program, something could be messing around with this output stream. That would break FizzBuzz.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s now try to use as many immutable values objects as possible, and see what happens to the mocks.</p>

<p>```ruby
require &lsquo;rspec&rsquo;</p>

<h1>We extracted a function to do the fizz buzz on a single number</h1>

<p>def fizzBuzzN(i)
  if (i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>"FizzBuzz"
</code></pre>

<p>  elsif (i%3 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>"Fizz"
</code></pre>

<p>  elsif (i%5 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>"Buzz"
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>i.to_s
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h1>We replaced the many calls to STDOUT.puts by building a single</h1>

<h1>large (and immutable) string</h1>

<p>def fizzBuzz(max)
  ((1..max).map {|i| fizzBuzzN(i)}).join(&ldquo;\n&rdquo;)
end</p>

<h1>main, with a single call to STDOUT.puts</h1>

<p>STDOUT.puts fizzBuzz(100)</p>

<p>describe &lsquo;Statist Fizz Buzz&rsquo; do</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print numbers not multiples of 3 or 5&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(fizzBuzzN(1)).to eq("1")
expect(fizzBuzzN(2)).to eq("2")
expect(fizzBuzzN(4)).to eq("4")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print Fizz for multiples of 3&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(fizzBuzzN(3)).to eq("Fizz")
expect(fizzBuzzN(6)).to eq("Fizz")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print Buzz for multiples of 3&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(fizzBuzzN(5)).to eq("Buzz")
expect(fizzBuzzN(10)).to eq("Buzz")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print FizzBuzz for multiples of 3 and 5&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(fizzBuzzN(15)).to eq("FizzBuzz")
expect(fizzBuzzN(30)).to eq("FizzBuzz")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print numbers, fizz and buzz&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(fizzBuzz(15)).to start_with("1\n2\nFizz").and(end_with("14\nFizzBuzz"))
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>As we can see, using immutable value objects got us rid of the mocks. Obviously, this new code will not be as efficient as the original version, but most of the time, this does not matter. As a bonus though we get finer grain and more readable tests.</p>

<h3>Other testing advantages</h3>

<p>Appart from preventing mocks, Immutable Value Objects have other advantages related to testing.</p>

<ul>
<li>We can directly assert their equality, without having to dig into their guts</li>
<li>We can call methods as many times as we want, without the risk of changing anything and breaking the tests</li>
<li>Immutable Value Objects are a lot less likely to contain invalid state. This removes the need for a whole range of validity tests.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Immutable Value Objects simplify testing in many ways.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Convincing your teammates</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that Immutable Value Objects have a ton of advantages when testing. People have found that they also have many other benefits :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140528113353-16837833-6-benefits-of-programming-with-immutable-objects-in-java/">6 Benefits of Programming with Immutable Objects in Java</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/5-benefits-of-immutable-objects-worth-considering-for-your-next-project-f98e7e85b6ac">5 Benefits of Immutable Objects Worth Considering for Your NextÂ Project</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Surprisingly though, it&rsquo;s difficult to persuade programmers to use more immutability. It&rsquo;s tricky to explain why returning a modified copy is simpler than just adding a setter.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Why is it so hard to persuade other developers to use immutable data structures ?</p></blockquote>

<p>I had the most success by far when encountering a bug resulting of share mutable state. When this happens, the long term benefits and safety of the immutable design wins people over. The good thing is that as you convince more people in the team, immutability will spread like a virus !</p>

<p>Outside of this situation, you might try some of the following arguments to move people :</p>

<ul>
<li>Immutable values prevent bugs caused by different parts of the system changing the same mutable state</li>
<li>They make it easier to deal with the program in smaller parts and to reason about the system in general</li>
<li>Immutable values don&rsquo;t need any synchronization and make multithreaded programming easier</li>
<li>When tempted to add a simple setter instead of keeping a class immutable, highlight the stressful debugging time to come</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re dealing with a Design By Contract adept, explain how <a href="/almost-15-years-of-using-design-by-contract/">immutability has it built-in</a></li>
<li>Admit that mainstream languages have bad support for Immutable Value. Point to patterns like <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/immutability-with-builder-design-pattern">Data Builders</a> that work around these limitation</li>
</ul>


<h2>Next post</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m done with immutable value objects. It was a far longer post than I thought, but there was a lot to say. This was the third post in a <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">series about avoiding mocks</a>. In next post, I&rsquo;ll dig into another small scale mock fighting pattern : <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builders</a>.</p>

    <updated>2017-01-25T07:53:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-minutes-hack-to-speed-up-rspec-in-rails-5-using-in-memory-sqlite</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is the story : you have a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails 5</a> app that uses <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>, but your RSpec suite is getting slower and slower to run. You&rsquo;ve already considered some solutions :</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> in memory for your test env.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>yaml
test:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: ":memory:"
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the most straightforward thing to do, but unfortunately, if you are sharing your test env with <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a>, you might want to use a production like DB with Cucumber (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> or whatever). So unless you are ready to setup a new env for cucumber (which I tried and don&rsquo;t recommend) you&rsquo;re stuck.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use mocks. That&rsquo;s surely going to work, it&rsquo;s going to make your test hell of a lot faster ! It will also make your tests a lot more fragile and more expensive to maintain &hellip; If you want to read more about why I think mocks are a bad idea, just have a look at <a href="/blog/categories/mocking/">these posts</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The hack</h2>

<p>Here is a third alternative, I&rsquo;ve <a href="/simplest-way-to-speed-up-rspec-with-in-memory-sqlite-db/">already written about it</a>, but here it comes updated and tested for Rails 5 :</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t change anything to your <code>config/database.yml</code></li>
<li>Obviously, you&rsquo;ll need to add <code>sqlite3</code> to your <code>Gemfile</code></li>
<li>At the beginning of your <code>spec/rails_helper.rb</code>, replace</li>
</ol>


<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>Checks for pending migration and applies them before tests are run.</h1>

<h1>If you are not using ActiveRecord, you can remove this line.</h1>

<p>ActiveRecord::Migration.maintain_test_schema!
```</p>

<p>with</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>In order to keep the same RAILS_ENV for rspec and cucumber, and to make rspec</h1>

<h1>faster, patch the connection to use sqlite in memory when running rspec</h1>

<p>ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: &lsquo;sqlite3&rsquo;, database: &lsquo;:memory:&rsquo;)
ActiveRecord::Schema.verbose = false
load &ldquo;#{Rails.root.to_s}/db/schema.rb&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it ! Run your specs &hellip; not bad for a 5 minutes investment !</p>

<h4>Rails 5.1 (2017-03-29 Edit)</h4>

<p>My fresh hack started to fail on Rails 5.1 ! If <code>schema.rb</code> is generated with the Postgres adapter, it is now incompatible with this injected Sqlite adapter. Here is a patch that removes the glitches :</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>In order to keep the same RAILS_ENV for rspec and cucumber, and to make rspec</h1>

<h1>faster, patch the connection to use sqlite in memory when running rspec</h1>

<p>ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: &lsquo;sqlite3&rsquo;, database: &lsquo;:memory:&rsquo;)
ActiveRecord::Schema.verbose = false</p>

<h1>load db agnostic schema by default. Needed to remove the &ldquo;, id: :serial&rdquo; from</h1>

<h1>the table definitions to make it load on sqlite</h1>

<p>eval(<code>cat #{Rails.root.to_s}/db/schema.rb | sed 's/,[^:]*: :serial\//g'</code>)
```</p>

<p>I admit this is getting a bit crappy, and I don&rsquo;t know how long it is going to work &hellip;</p>

<h2>One more thing &hellip;</h2>

<p>If you need even more speed, you can now run your specs in parallel in different processes ! Each in-memory SQLite DB is bound to its process, so unlike a real PostgreSQL dev DB, you won&rsquo;t get any conflicts between your tests ;&ndash;)</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/verify-the-big-o-complexity-of-ruby-code-in-rspec/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-04T17:48:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/verify-the-big-o-complexity-of-ruby-code-in-rspec</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It might be possible to discover performance regressions before running your long and large scale benchmarks !</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/philou/complexity-assert">complexity_assert</a> is an <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> library that determines and checks the <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/">big O complexity</a> of a piece of code. Once you&rsquo;ve determined the performance critical sections of your system, you can use it to verify that they perform with the complexity you expect.</p>

<h2>How does it work ?</h2>

<p>The gem itself is the result of an experiment to learn machine learning in 20 hours (you can read more about that experiment in <a href="/how-i-got-my-feet-wet-with-machine-learning-with-the-first-20-hours/">my previous post</a> if you want).</p>

<p>Suppose you have some a method, let&rsquo;s call it <code>match_products_with_orders(products, orders)</code> which is called in in one of your processes with very large arguments. Badly written, this method could be quadratic (O(nÂ²)), which would lead to catastrophic performances in production. When coding it, you&rsquo;ve taken particular care to make it perform in linear time. Unfortunately, it could easily slip back to a slower implementation with a bad refactoring &hellip; Using complexity_assert, you can make sure that this does not happen :</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>An adapter class to fit the code to measure in complexity assert</h1>

<p>class ProductsOrdersMatching</p>

<pre><code># Generate some arguments of a particular size
def generate_args(size)
    # Let's assume we have 10 times less products than orders
    [ Array.new(size / 10) { build_a_product() }, Array.new(size) { build_an_order() } ]
end

# Run the code on which we want to assert performance
def run(products, orders)
    match_products_with_orders(products, orders)
end
</code></pre>

<p>end</p>

<p>describe &ldquo;Products and Orders Matching&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>it "performs linearly" do
    # Verify that the code runs in time proportional to the size of its arguments
    expect(ProductOrdersMatching.new).to be_linear()
end
</code></pre>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it ! If ever someone changes the code of <code>match_products_with_orders</code> and makes it perform worse than linearly, the assertion will fail ! There are similar assertions to check for constant and quadratic execution times.</p>

<p>Internally, the code will be called a number of times with different (smallish) sizes of arguments and the execution times will be logged. When this is over, by doing different flavors of linear regressions, it should determine whether the algorithm performs in O(1), O(n) or O(nÂ²). Depending on your code, this can take time to run, but should still be faster than running large scale benchmarks.</p>

<p>Just check the <a href="https://github.com/philou/complexity-assert/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Did you say experiment ?</h2>

<p>It all started like an experiment. So the gem itself, is still experimental ! It&rsquo;s all fresh, and it could receive a lot of enhancements like :</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow the assertion to specify the sizes</li>
<li>Allow the assertion to specify the warm-up and run rounds</li>
<li>Robustness against garbage collection : use GC intensive ruby methods, and see how the regression behaves</li>
<li>Find ways to make the whole thing faster</li>
<li>O(lnx) : pre-treat with exp()</li>
<li>O(?lnx) : use exp, then a search for the coefficient (aka polynomial)</li>
<li>O(xlnx) : there is no well known inverse for that, we can compute it numerically though</li>
<li>Estimate how much the assert is deterministic</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>As you see, there&rsquo;s a lot of room for ideas and improvements.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/rspecproxies-now-supports-to-receive-xxx-dot-dot-dot-syntax/"/>
    <updated>2016-08-23T04:47:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/rspecproxies-now-supports-to-receive-xxx-dot-dot-dot-syntax</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-08-23-rspecproxies-now-supports-to-receive-xxx-dot-dot-dot-syntax/test_probes.jpg" title="Hardware test probes" ></p>

<p>Pure mocks are dangerous. They let defect go through, give a false sense of security and are difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already talked about it <a href="/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">before</a> but since then, <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">DHH announced that he was quitting TDD</a>, the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/">Is TDD Dead ?</a> debate took place, and the conclusion is that <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/mockists-are-dead-long-live-classicists">mockist are dead</a>.</p>

<p>They are still times when mocks feel much simpler than any other things. For example, imagine your process leaks and crashes after 10 hours, the fix is to pass an option to a thirdparty, how would you test this in a fast test ? That&rsquo;s exactly the kind of situation where using test proxies saves you from mocks. A test proxy defers everything to the real object but also features unintrusive hooks and probes that you can use in your test. If you want a code example, check <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/commit/2c9fce17f9b59d0b3828f309015c07b17cceddf4?diff=split">this commit</a>, where I refactored a rails controller test from mocks to a RSpecProxies (v0.1).</p>

<p>I created RSpecProxies <a href="/my-new-gem-for-creating-rspec-proxies/">a while ago</a>, a while ago, and it&rsquo;s syntax made it alien to the RSpec work, it needed an update. <a href="http://rspec.info">RSpec</a> now supports basic proxying with partial stubs, spies, the <code>and_call_original</code> and the <code>and_wrap_original</code> methods. <a href="https://github.com/philou/rspecproxies">RSpecProxies 1.0</a> is a collection of hooks built on top of these to make proxying easier, with a syntax that will be familiar to RSpec users.</p>

<h2>Before original hook</h2>

<p>This hook is triggered before a call a method. Suppose you want to simulate a bad connection :</p>

<p>```ruby
it &lsquo;can simulate unreliable connection&rsquo; do
  i = 0
  allow(Resource).to receive(:get).and_before_calling_original { |*args|</p>

<pre><code>i += 1
raise RuntimeError.new if i % 3 == 0
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  resources = Resource.get_at_least(10)</p>

<p>  expect(resources.size).to eq(10)
end
```</p>

<h2>After original hooks</h2>

<p>RSpecProxies provides the same kind of hook after the call :</p>

<p>``` ruby
it &lsquo;can check that the correct data is used (using and_after_calling_original&rsquo; do
  user = nil
  allow(User).to receive(:load).and_after_calling_original { |result| user = result }</p>

<p>  controller.login(&lsquo;joe&rsquo;, &lsquo;secret&rsquo;)</p>

<p>  expect(response).to include(user.created_at.to_s)
end
```</p>

<p>Here we are capturing the return value to use it later in the test. For this special purpose, RSpecProxies also provides 2 other helpers :</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>Store the latest result in @user of self</h1>

<p>allow(User).to receive(:load).and_capture_result_into(self, :user)</p>

<h1>Collect all results in the users array</h1>

<p>users = []
allow(User).to receive(:load).and_collect_results_into(users)
```</p>

<h2>Proxy chains</h2>

<p>RSpec mocks provides the <code>message_chain</code> feature to do build chains of stubs. RSpecProxy provides a very similar proxy chain concept. The main difference is that it creates proxies along the way, and not pure stubs. Pure stubs assume that you are mocking everything, but as our goal is to mock as little as possible, using proxies makes more sense.</p>

<p>When using a mockist approach, the message chain is a bad smell because it makes your tests very brittle by depending on a lot of implementation. In contrast, proxy chains are meant to be used where they are the simplest way to inject what you need, without creating havoc.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to display the progress of a very slow background task. You could mock a lot of your objects to have a fast test, of if you wanted to avoid all the bad side effects of mocking, you could run the background task in your test, and have a slow test &hellip; Or, you could use a chain of proxies :</p>

<p>``` ruby
it &lsquo;can override a deep getter&rsquo; do
  allow(RenderingTask).to proxy_message_chain(&ldquo;load.completion_ratio&rdquo;) { |e| e.and_return(0.2523) }</p>

<p>  controller.show</p>

<p>  expect(response).to include(&lsquo;25%&rsquo;)
end
```</p>

<p>Here the simplest thing to do is just to override a small getter, because from a functionnal point of view, that&rsquo;s exactly what we want to test.</p>

<h2>Last word</h2>
