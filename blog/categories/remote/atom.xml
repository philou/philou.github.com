    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember how people who are not used to the phone tend to shout in it, for the message to get far ? Read on and I&rsquo;ll explain how this silly habit will make your remote retrospectives great !</p>

<p>A typical retrospective starts with an energizing activity, or <a href="http://www.funretrospectives.com/category/energizer/">energizer</a>. It&rsquo;s important for two reasons. First, people who don&rsquo;t speak during the first 5 minutes of a meeting are more likely to remain silent until the end. Second, getting everyone to do an energizing and fun activity sets the tone for a peaceful and creative time.</p>

<h2>Our experiences with remote energizers</h2>

<p>When we started to do retrospectives at work, all the team was co located in Paris. There are tons of activities available on the internet to run effective energizers. We could do games like Fizz Buzz, or drawing based activities like <a href="http://www.funretrospectives.com/collaborative-face-drawing/">face drawing</a> and <a href="http://www.funretrospectives.com/visual-phone/">visual phone</a>. It was easy and fun.</p>

<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://ahmadatwi.me/">Ahmad Atwi</a> joined our team from Beirut. Our catalog of energizer shrank to a few activities that we could run remotely. On top of that, going through the remote medium made it more challenging for energizers to &hellip; energize ! With time and trial, we managed to understand what works and how to pick the right energizer for a remote team.</p>

<h2>Principles for remote energizers</h2>

<p>We have an Agile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Interest_Group">Special Interest Group</a> at <a href="https://www.murex.com/">Murex</a>, where volunteers meet to share things they find interesting. A few weeks ago, during one of these sessions, we discussed remote energizers in a <a href="http://leancoffee.org/">Lean Coffee</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the points we came up with.</p>

<ul>
<li>Question activities work great through <a href="https://trello.com/agileretrospectives">Trello</a>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977616649/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0977616649&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pbourgau-20&amp;linkId=2b51890b8e8909b6f2223ca69ec3b26f">Agile Retrospectives, making good teams great</a> details such a Check-In activity. The typical questions sound like &ldquo;Coming into this retrospective, if you were a car, what kind of car would you be ?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977616649/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0977616649&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pbourgau-20&amp;linkId=2b51890b8e8909b6f2223ca69ec3b26f"><img src="../imgs/2017-08-18-5-remote-energizer-tips-that-will-make-your-remote-retrospectives-rock/agile-retros.jpg" alt="The Agile Retrospectives, making good teams great book cover" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>If they are enough teammates at every place, energizers that play in small groups will work well. For example, it would be easy to organize a <a href="http://www.funretrospectives.com/the-balloon-battle/">balloon battle</a> or a <a href="http://www.funretrospectives.com/back-to-back/">back to back</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/remote-or-co-located.html"><img src="../imgs/2017-08-18-5-remote-energizer-tips-that-will-make-your-remote-retrospectives-rock/multi-site-team.png" alt="The Agile Retrospectives, making good teams great book cover" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s also easy to use variations on an activity that proved effective. For example, explore new kinds of questions. It&rsquo;s even ok to repeat verbatim an activity from time to time.</li>
<li>Replace energizing by team building. Team building is particularly important for remote teams. Instead of engaging activities, it&rsquo;s ok to have everyone share a personal anecdote. By knowing each other better, the team can build trust. For example, you could introduce such an activity with : &ldquo;What book would you bring on a desert island ? Why ?&rdquo;</li>
<li>One last thing we came up with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/mc_moe">Morgan Kobeissi</a> to energize a remote meeting is to YELL. The idea is to ask everyone to answer a question while standing and yelling. A question could be &ldquo;How long have you been working and what companies did you work for ?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Remote work is here to stay. More and more teams are facing similar difficulties. We need to invent new work practices. If you discovered new ways to run remote energizer, please share them with a comment.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My colleague <a href="https://ahmadatwi.me/">Ahmad</a> from Beirut gave a talk at <a href="http://www.agiletourbeirut.org/">Agile Tour Beirut</a> on Saturday about how we adopted <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</a> to a distributed team <a href="http://www.murex.com">at work</a>. I gave him a hand and played the remote guy during the talk.</p>

<p>With me through Skype, we did a first demo of remote pair programming on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">FizzBuzz</a> using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IDEA</a> and <a href="https://floobits.com">Floobits</a></p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5nKyfeq9CY0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>We then did a demo of <a href="/trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/">remote retrospectives</a> using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a></p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCRM3rvb8WA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>When should I use ReXP</h2>

<p>The conclusion is that :</p>

<ul>
<li>If people are spread over 2 or a few cities, and that they are enough at every place to build a teams, just build different teams at every location</li>
<li>If people are spread over a lot of places, maybe involving many time zones, then the open source, pull request based work-flow seems the best</li>
<li>Otherwise, if there are not enough people to build 2 teams, that they are spread over only a few locations, that the time difference is not too big, then stretching XP to Remote will work best</li>
</ul>


<p>As it is said that &ldquo;nothing beats XP for small collocated teams&rdquo;, I guess &ldquo;nothing beats ReXP for small almost collocated teams&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Tools to make it better</h2>

<p>As Ahmad said in his talk, tools already exist. We could add that more would be welcome :</p>

<ul>
<li>Floobits or <a href="http://www.saros-project.org/">Saros</a> help tremendously for remote pairing, but maybe cloud based IDEs like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/che/">Eclipse Che</a> or <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud 9</a> will make all these tools useless !</li>
<li>Trello works well for remote retrospectives, but some great activities like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">5 whys</a> are still difficult to do with Trello. I&rsquo;m sure new tools could do better.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m currently building a <a href="https://github.com/philou/planning-poker">remote planning poker app</a></li>
<li>My other colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/mc_moe">Morgan</a> wants to build a virtual stand up token to make it flow</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-05T06:18:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a distributed team working from Paris and Beirut, after <a href="/from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/">pair programming</a>, it was time for our retrospectives to get remote !</p>

<p><a href="/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/setup.jpg"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/setup-small.jpg" title="A remote retrospective meeting with Trello setup" ></a></p>

<h2>Initial setup</h2>

<p>At first we were using the visio conference system. The retrospective facilitator would connect with the remote participants through instant chat and forward theirs post-its. We also used an extra webcam connected to the laptop in order to show the whiteboard in the other room.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>Anyone can do it now</li>
<li>Kind of works</li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>We often used to loose 5 minutes setting all the infrastructure up</li>
<li>The remote room cannot see the board clearly through the webcam</li>
<li>The animator has to spend his time forwarding the other room&rsquo;s points</li>
<li>There is a &lsquo;master&rsquo; and a &lsquo;slave&rsquo; room</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sensei Tool</h2>

<p>When Mohamad joined the team in Beirut, we thought that this was not going to scale &hellip; We decided to try something else. With the availability of the new conferencing system, we had the idea to use a web tool to run the retro. We found and tried <a href="http://senseitool.com/">senseitool.com</a>. After creating accounts for every member of the team and scheduling a retrospective through the tool, we could all equally participate using our smartphones. The retrospective follows a typical workflow that is fine for teams new to the practice.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>Even easier to setup</li>
<li>Works fine</li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>The website was a bit slow</li>
<li>The retrospective was too guided for an experienced team, we did not get as good outputs as we used to</li>
<li>Everyone could participate as easily</li>
</ul>


<h2>Trello</h2>

<p><a href="/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/boat.jpg"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/boat-small.jpg" title="The boat activity on Trello" ></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.fr/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=remote%20retrospective">Asking Google</a>, we discovered that some teams were having success using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> for their remote retrospectives. We decided to give it a try. Ahmad from Beirut got to work on our first retrospective with it. He had to prepare it beforehand (as we always have been doing). In practice :</p>

<ul>
<li>Ahmad created an organization for our team</li>
<li>We all registered to Trello and joined the organization (we like joining (smile))</li>
<li>Ahmad created a custom board for each activity</li>
<li>During the meeting, we used the video conferencing system and the instant chat to have both visio and screen sharing</li>
<li>The animator used a laptop to manage the Trello boards</li>
<li>Everyone of us could add post-its through his smartphone app</li>
</ul>


<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>The setup is easy</li>
<li>The retrospective worked well and delivered interesting output</li>
<li>We actually all see the board</li>
<li>The smartphone app works well</li>
<li>It is possible to vote directly through Trello</li>
<li>Everyone could participate as easily</li>
<li>We can classify post-its with labels</li>
<li>We can insert pictures and photos</li>
<li>There are a lot of chrome extensions to Trello (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vertical-lists-for-trello/aldklnbenbdgfgfbflalmlddkkndgnlc?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog">Vertical Lists for Trello</a>), <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/card-color-titles-for-tre/hpmobkglehhleflhaefmfajhbdnjmgim?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog">Card Color Titles for Trello</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>There is nothing to &lsquo;group&rsquo; post its together</li>
<li>We need to prepare custom boards for every activity</li>
<li>We would need to pay for the gold version with custom backgrounds and stickers</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><a href="/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/roti.jpg"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/roti-small.jpg" title="The Return On Time Invested activity on Trello" ></a></p>

<p>While missing a few features that would make it awesome, Trello is the best tool we found for remote retrospective, and is better than our initial physical setup. We&rsquo;re continuing to use it, and we now have to figure out</p>

<ul>
<li>If we could find a way to speed up the meeting preparation</li>
<li>How to handle &lsquo;graph oriented&rsquo; activities such as the &lsquo;5 whys&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
