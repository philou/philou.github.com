    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First, i recommend <a href="http://sideprojectbook.com/">this book</a> to any side project infected person : it&rsquo;s a great motivation boost !</p>

<p>After reading it, it seems that there are no absolute rules to side projects success. Some did no marketting and just did what they loved, others did à carefull market study before building anything, some did the whole things, others outsourced the code or the design, or even both &hellip; That said, as I read somewhere, it seems that one is more likely to achieve commercial success if he first focusses on the market, then marketting, then the design, and eventually on the features.</p>

<p>Common advices from the interviewees are :</p>

<ul>
<li>ship early</li>
<li>iterate</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t give up</li>
</ul>


<p>Why not apply these principle to &ldquo;building a side project&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;building XXX in my free time&rdquo; ?</p>

<p>From now on, I am going to set up project target duration and revenue. For example, if I don&rsquo;t make at least 100€ / month after one year, I&rsquo;ll stop working on it and start a new one.</p>

<p>I hope that by iterating more quickly through projects I&rsquo;ll learn more and increase my chances of successes as the time goes. Keeping the same target duration and revenue for all projects should make me better at filtering ideas that are a good fit to my resources. As I tend to get bored quickly, it should also allow me to keep my motivation high.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As agile and lean methodologies are gaining some place inside the workplace, especially in large corporations, I heard and saw quite a few teams struggling with their whiteboard because of :</p>

<ul>
<li>falling post-its</li>
<li>too few magnets</li>
<li>looking alike customized magnets</li>
</ul>


<p>The best practice seemed to order magnetic paper, and loose half a day to create individual avatars, print them and stick them to small pieces of magnetic paper.</p>

<p>This is the main idea behind <a href="http://www.agileavatars.com">AgileAvatars.com</a>. The main feature would be :</p>

<ul>
<li>create the avatars for your whole team</li>
<li>pass a group order, and receive the whole package directly at work</li>
</ul>


<p>For the moment, I am just testing the idea, so please enter your email in <a href="http://www.agileavatars.com">the contact form</a> to push the product. Tweet about it and it will be even better !</p>

<p>If it turns out people are interested, I&rsquo;ll start defining the MVP with the interested users :</p>

<ul>
<li>How much should I charge to burn the magnets ?</li>
<li>Should it be a web or phone app ?</li>
<li>How to create the avatars ?</li>
</ul>
