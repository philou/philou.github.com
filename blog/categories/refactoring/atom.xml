    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-1-constant-merciless-refactoring/">My previous post</a> was about how to get slots of time in your daily (or weekly) work to do some refactoring. I left my readers with the promise of techniques to fit the refactoring work into these small slots.</p>

<p>Obviously, it won&rsquo;t be possible to perform any refactoring of any size in this way. With a bit of discipline and know-how though, it is possible to deal with quite a lot by splitting them up.</p>

<p>Baby steps are small increments of working software. The idea is that we test, commit, integrate and even deploy every small code change ! Using baby steps, we can perform large scale refactorings little by little. Refactoring in this way might seem involved, but it&rsquo;s so much safer that it&rsquo;s <a href="/7-reasons-why-learning-refactoring-techniques-will-improve-your-life-as-a-software-engineer/">a no brainer once you&rsquo;ve tried it</a> ! Refactoring in baby steps can be challenging to master though.</p>

<p>10 years ago, I used to work in a large bank in Paris. I had been dabbling on my own with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">eXtreme Programming</a> for a few years, when we started a small project. I was to become the informal XP coach. The project was about connecting to an online brokering service. It involved adapting an existing domain library. It went out pretty well. More precisely, we created very few bugs in production, which was very different from the norm at the time. I remember this feedback from the manager :</p>

<blockquote><p>We managed to move the code from X to Y through a succession of working baby steps ! That&rsquo;s pretty uncommon ! A manager in 2006</p></blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that this was 10 years ago. We had not done anything special except trying to apply eXtreme Programming. Nowadays, as Continuous Integration has become mainstream these skills are becoming more common. That said, we still need to learn how to apply incremental software development to large scale refactoring. This is what I&rsquo;m going to write about today.</p>

<p>This is the seventh post in a <a href="/blog/categories/large-scale-refactoring-sponsorship-series/">series about how to get sponsorship for large scale refactoring</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, I encourage you to start from <a href="/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<h2>Team TDD Coding Dojos</h2>

<p>Learning to work in baby steps is not as complicated as it might first seem. The safest and easiest way is to setup a <a href="/blog/categories/team-randori-series/">team TDD coding dojo</a>. With its Red-Green-Refactor loop TDD sets up a baby steps rhythm. As I&rsquo;ll explain in <a href="http://eepurl.com/dxKE95">my next post</a>, baby steps work best when all the team uses them. That&rsquo;s another thing the team Coding Dojo helps with.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ TDD has a baby steps rhythm baked in.</p></blockquote>

<p>We can push the learning further. For example, we can use the <a href="http://kata-log.rocks/baby-steps">baby steps constraint</a> during a few coding dojo sessions. With this constraint, we revert the code if tests fail for more than 2 minutes ! Here is a way to go at it :</p>

<ol>
<li>Setup <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Testing-Ruby-Rails-JavaScript/dp/1934356700/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1533638529&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=continuous+testing">continuous testing</a> : <a href="https://www.ncrunch.net/">NCrunch</a> in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net">.Net</a>, <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a> in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/fr/">Ruby</a> or <a href="http://infinitest.github.io/">Infinitest</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language">Java</a>)</li>
<li>Only use automated refactorings or extremely simple code changes in order to &hellip;.</li>
<li>&hellip; keep the code compiling all the time &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; and cut the time the tests fail as much as possible</li>
</ol>


<h2>Mikado Method</h2>

<p>One way to keep the tests green all the time is to use a slightly different TDD loop, as <a href="http://natpryce.com/articles/000780.html">Nat Pryce suggests</a> :</p>

<p><a href="http://natpryce.com/articles/000780.html"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-08-07-incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-2-baby-steps/listening-to-the-tests.png" alt="The red-green-refactor loop of TDD with an extra green arrow from failing test to refactor. This alternate TDD loop illustrates how to take baby steps with the Mikado Method" /></a></p>

<div class="image-credits">From <a href="http://natpryce.com">Nat Pryce's</a> <a href="http://natpryce.com/articles/000780.html">blog</a></div>


<br>


<p>Here is how it goes.Â </p>

<ol>
<li>Add a new failing testÂ </li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s trivial to fix, fix it. We are done</li>
<li>If not, see what&rsquo;s missing in the code</li>
<li>Comment the test to get back to a green state</li>
<li>Refactor the code to add what&rsquo;s missing (and use other tests if needed)</li>
<li>Uncomment the test</li>
<li>Repeat from step 2</li>
</ol>


<p>When doing this at the scale of a real life story or feature, we&rsquo;d use <code>git stash</code> instead of comments. This way of working has a name, it&rsquo;s called the <a href="https://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/">Mikado Method</a>. It is at the heart of making baby steps work in real life.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ The Mikado Method is at the heart of making baby steps work in real life</p></blockquote>

<h2>Take a break</h2>

<p>With TDD and the Mikado Method we can put the refactoring on pause. We can perform a small increment of the refactoring, commit and deploy it &hellip; and pause ! We&rsquo;ll work on business features for a while, and resume the refactoring later on.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-08-07-incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-2-baby-steps/coffee-break.jpg" alt="A cup of coffee next to a computer. Developers can pause their large scale refactoring if they work in small enough baby steps" /></p>

<p>When done well, it feels slow. We have to remember that the alternative is to convince business people of prioritizing a refactoring &hellip; As we&rsquo;ll regularly ship baby steps of a large scale refactoring, we&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;re on the good track !</p>

<h2>More to come</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, even with bandwidth and skills, we are not there yet &hellip; It&rsquo;s one thing for developers to do incremental software development of large scale refactoring on their own. It&rsquo;s another to do it as a team !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/incremental-software-development-techniques-for-large-scale-refactorings/">My previous post</a> advocated incremental software development for large scale refactorings. It&rsquo;s less risky and it prevents tunnel effects. Most of all, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to convince business people of engaging in a refactoring this way.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to understand why it&rsquo;s the way to go, but it&rsquo;s another to be able to do it ! In this post, I&rsquo;ll start by explaining how to find the time to do constant <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/refactor.html">merciless refactoring</a>.</p>

<p>This is the sixth post in <a href="/blog/categories/large-scale-refactoring-sponsorship-series/">a series about how to get sponsorship for large scale refactoring</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, I encourage you to start from <a href="/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-08-02-incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-1-constant-merciless-refactoring/recurring-cleanup.jpg" alt="Constant Merciless Refactoring illustrated as a recurring cleanup activity" /></p>

<h2><del>Steal</del> Take the time for constant merciless refactoring</h2>

<blockquote><p>If it hurts, do it more often ! <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.html">Wisdom of the internet</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As a child, I used to be a very untidy kid. Every few week, my room would get in a real mess, and my mum would order me to clean all this mess. I would then lose 1 or 2 hours tidying my room up. She used to tell me that if I kept things tidy as I used them, I would not have to lose this time. From the top of my 10 years old, I would judge this advice as nonsense.Â </p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-08-02-incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-1-constant-merciless-refactoring/messy-bedroom.jpg" alt="This is the kind of mess my bedroom used to be in, when I was a kid, before I learned the virtues of constant merciless refactoring" /></p>

<p>Fast forward a few years, I am myself a parent and I&rsquo;ve been working with legacy code for many years. These years have taught me how much I was wrong &hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ The easiest refactorings to negotiate are the ones we don&rsquo;t have to talk about !</p></blockquote>

<p>The more refactoring we embed in &lsquo;Business As Usual&rsquo;, the more we&rsquo;ll do, and the less we&rsquo;ll argue with the business. We can wonder if this is still &lsquo;professional&rsquo; ? In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-Pragmatic-Software/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1533190334&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile">The Art Of Agile Development</a>, <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/">James Shore</a> explains that managing technical debt is the key to long term productivity. (Details in the <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/risk_management.html">Risk Management section of his book</a>). As developers, <em>we</em> are the only experts in the code, the responsibility to keep it clean falls on us.</p>

<blockquote><p>Never ask the permission to do a good job ! <a href="http://docondev.com/">Doc Norton</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to constant merciless refactoring ! It also keeps us in a good position to accept new features or refactorings later down the road.</p>

<p>Following are the 3 practices that make up constant merciless refactoring.</p>

<h2>Yesterday&rsquo;s weather and slack time</h2>

<p>20 years ago, a promises of agile software development was to stick to a <a href="http://www.sustainablepace.net/what-is-sustainable-pace">sustainable pace</a>. When we are working with a flavor of <a href="https://www.scrum.org/">Scrum</a>, we can rely on it&rsquo;s literature to inject some <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">slack time</a>. Â Slack time is buffer time at the end of every iteration. We should not plan any work during the slack, to accommodate with the unexpected. It&rsquo;s a way to deliver on forecasts, whatever happens.</p>

<p>In short, if your velocity chart looks something like that :</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-08-02-incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-1-constant-merciless-refactoring/velocity.jpg" alt="Drawing of a fluctuating team velocity. This is often the result of not enough constant merciless refactoring" /></p>

<p>Scrum tells us to plan what you delivered in your worst iteration for the next one ! When things will work bad, we&rsquo;re still pretty likely to deliver what we wanted. When things work well, we&rsquo;ll have time to tackle refactoring.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to say about slack time. How to take some when you are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a> ? How to make sure you keep some when your velocity becomes pretty stable ? How to do you increase your velocity in the long term ? (I guess I&rsquo;ll have to write a full blog post about this some day.)</p>

<h2>The Boy Scout Rule</h2>

<p>I already blogged about the <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1235624&amp;seqNum=6">Boy Scout Rule</a>. Here is how <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/">Uncle Bob</a> wrote it :</p>

<blockquote><p>Always leave the file you are editing a little better than you found it. Bob Martin</p></blockquote>

<p>Following this simple rule goes a long way to keep the code clean and ready for larger refactorings. It works arm in arm with Yesterday&rsquo;s weather principle. The extra time we take for clean up impacts our capacity to plan stories and features. This creates time to keep on doing the boy scout rule in future iterations.</p>

<p>How &lsquo;clean&rsquo; the code should be is a team decision. Coding conventions and a static code analyzer are very important to track the boy scout rule. I learned that code reviews, pairing, mobbing and <a href="/blog/categories/team-randori-series/">coding dojos</a> are great to agree on coding conventions.</p>

<h2>Embedding refactoring in features</h2>

<p>The Test Driven Development loop goes as Red-Green-Refactor.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-08-02-incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-1-constant-merciless-refactoring/red-green-refactor.jpg" alt="TDD's Red-Green-Refactor loop. Itself highlighting Constant Merciless Refactoring as a recurring activity" /></p>

<p>The same loop goes on at larger scale for Acceptance or Feature Test. When repeated many times, the loop could as well be Refactor &ndash; Red &ndash; Green. In fact, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to refactor when you know what feature you want to build than at the end of the previous one. (Nat Pryce <a href="http://natpryce.com/articles/000780.html">wrote about that</a> in more details)</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ &ldquo;Disguise&rdquo; refactoring as first technical sub tasks of features to get them prioritized.</p></blockquote>

<p>All this to say, we should start our features with the pre-requisite refactoring ! We should not build features on shaky foundations. We should also impact our estimates. In fact, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to justify to business people at that moment. We don&rsquo;t need to mention &lsquo;refactoring&rsquo; or &lsquo;clean up&rsquo;. We can use technical sub-tasks to track these technical refactorings. Technical sub-tasks are the team&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t need to be understandable by business people.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-08-02-incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-1-constant-merciless-refactoring/tech-tasks-sea-level.jpg" alt="Technical tasks drawn &quot;Under the sea&quot; and visible to devs only. This leaves them room to do constant merciless refactoring" /></p>

<h2>To be continued</h2>

<p>Finding the time for constant merciless refactoring is one thing, but how do we fit the work in these short slots ? In the <a href="/incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-2-baby-steps/">next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll continue about how to actually work in baby steps.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="/principles-that-will-make-you-become-a-badass-developer/">previous post</a> was about the badass developer attitude. More specifically, how it can buy sponsorship for large scale refactorings. Unfortunately, attitude is not enough. We also need to be able to deliver in a way that builds trust with the business. Most of all, business <a href="/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">is scared of the tunnel effect</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">Incremental software development</a> techniques allows to deliver large scale refactoring step by step. Not only that, but it also allows to do so alongside business features. That&rsquo;s how badass developers walk their talk and gain the business people&rsquo;s trust.</p>

<p>This is the fifth post in <a href="/blog/categories/large-scale-refactoring-sponsorship-series/">a series about how to get sponsorship for large scale refactoring</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, I encourage you to start from <a href="/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-07-20-incremental-software-development-techniques-for-large-scale-refactorings/incremental-plant.jpg" alt="Drawing of a plant at different stages of growth, illustrating Incremental Software Development" /></p>

<h2>Why does incremental software development matter ?</h2>

<h3>A short story</h3>

<p>A few years ago, I joined a team whose work involved a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain Specific Language</a> and a parser. The parser had grown in an ad-hoc way for a few years, and was now both very brittle and difficult to extend. We knew the way to go was to adopt a more solid parsing approach. We wanted to migrate to <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-pass_compiler">multi pass parser</a>.</p>

<p>As always, the business was very pushy for new features. There was no way we could have stoped everything for a full parser re-write. We explained to them that some of their features would be impossible to write without the new parser. We suggested that we work on migrating the parser as a background technical Epic. We did so using incremental software development techniques.</p>

<p>It took us a few months to migrate the parser. Meanwhile, we kept the software in a releasable state. This allowed us to validate our progress on the refactoring. We could continue to release features. We were able to share our progress on the refactoring with Â the business people. They were very happy with the way we did this refactoring. In fact, it set a standard about how to prepare the software for big features later on.</p>

<h3>The real problems</h3>

<p>To understand why incremental software development works, let&rsquo;s understand the alternatives' problems. The main alternative it to do the refactoring in one massive task. This kind of initiative screams &ldquo;Tunnel effect waiting to happen&rdquo; ! The <a href="http://www.wethetalent.co/data-robots-ai/the-tunnel-effect-and-the-abstruse-trap/">tunnel effect</a> scares business people for 3 reasons :</p>

<ol>
<li>Because they don&rsquo;t know how much money they&rsquo;ll need to put in the tunnel to get out of it</li>
<li>Because they don&rsquo;t know when they&rsquo;ll get the other features which they are also waiting for</li>
<li>To be blocked in the tunnel if something unexpected and important comes along</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-07-20-incremental-software-development-techniques-for-large-scale-refactorings/tunnel-effect.jpg" alt="Picture of someone holding a light, alone in a tunnel. Incremental Software Development helps to avoid the tunnel effect when performing a large scale refactoring" /></p>

<p>Delivering a large scale refactoring with incremental software development fixes these 3 points.</p>

<ul>
<li>Every commit is a step forward while keeping the system in a releasable state. If ever something unexpected comes along, we can pause the refactoring for a while. (point 3)</li>
<li>Not all the team has to work on refactoring at the same time. Working on the refactoring does not block the delivery of other features. (point 2)</li>
<li>Finally, after working on a refactoring for a while, it becomes easier to have an idea of how long it will take. (point 1)</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Incremental software development fixes the business people&rsquo;s fear of refactoring tunnel.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is true that performing the refactoring in one team-wide batch would be more efficient. It would reduce the overall Work In Progress and get it done quicker. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also a lot more scary for business people !</p>

<h2>Incremental Software Development techniques</h2>

<p>Like any skills, we can learn these techniques. Some are easy, and we can learn them from books. Others are more difficult and are usually learned through hard won experience. They can also be learned from a veteran developer in your team who&rsquo;s been through all this already. If you aren&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t have a veteran around, we can still manage. <a href="https://medium.com/the-crossover-cast/deliberate-practice-learn-like-an-expert-cc3114b8a10e">Deliberate practice</a> is a great way to <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-i-got-my-feet-wet-with-machine-learning-with-the-first-20-hours/">learn almost anything</a>. <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/coding-dojo/">Coding dojos</a> are the thing here (I&rsquo;ll write more about this later).</p>

<p>Once we master these skills, a lot of things change. First, we can do refactoring without harming our relationship with business people. Second, it builds enough self confidence among developers to negotiate with business people. This in itself, makes us more credible in their eyes. As a result, they are more likely to compromise on prioritizing refactoring.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Mastering incremental software development builds self-confidence for developers.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/5-mistakes-badass-developers-never-do/">last post</a>, I went over things we should avoid if we want to become badass developers. As I said though, this is far from enough. Once we&rsquo;ve stoped losing trust from the business, it&rsquo;s time to build some more ! This is the forth post in <a href="/blog/categories/large-scale-refactoring-sponsorship-series/">a series about how to get sponsorship for a large scale refactoring</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, start reading from <a href="/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>The badass developers gain the business&rsquo;s trust by sneaking in as business partners. A good way to become one is to start acting like one ! Here are examples of principles for that.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-07-09-principles-that-will-make-you-become-a-badass-developer/badass-principles-tatoo.jpg" alt="Arm of a badass developer with the tatoo '&gt; Badass Principles;' " /></p>

<h2>Keeping the business best interests in mind</h2>

<p>This is all about decision making. We should try to steer decisions according to the business. Whenever we talk with business people, we should stay aways from technical topics. I still remember my younger self explaining threading details to a trader &hellip; Most of all I remember the look on his face ! We should avoid technical bla bla, but we should be clear about the business consequences.</p>

<h2>Honesty and Candor</h2>

<p>When we don&rsquo;t agree with something, we should say so. When we don&rsquo;t understand something, we should ask the question. We need to stick to facts and assume everyone has the business&rsquo;s best interests in mind. Candor is a way to get our opinions and questions through, without sounding rude or pushy. There&rsquo;s a whole chapter about candor in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531133278&amp;sr=8-1">Creativity.inc</a>, the book about Pixar.</p>

<p>With time, business people will think of us as a positive and <a href="/real-developers-ship/">pragmatic problem solvers</a>. That is exactly the kind of people they want to work with !</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Candor is a way to get our opinions and questions through, without sounding rude or pushy.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Strong opinions, but weekly held</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror">Jeff Atwood</a>, already <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">wrote</a> about this. The idea is to fight for our opinions, but let them go without a fuss when we proved wrong. We know that we are all very often wrong. Only fools or self-centered people don&rsquo;t admit this reality. Business people won&rsquo;t trust us in either case. We need to show that we can go over our previous opinions. This grows our reputation of rational problem solver.</p>

<h2>Acknowledging when we don&rsquo;t know</h2>

<p>The same logic goes with knowledge. None of us knows everything. We have to admit when we don&rsquo;t know something and ask for help. This proves that we place the business&rsquo;s speed over our personal &lsquo;know-it-all&rsquo; reputation.</p>

<p>Here is a story that happened to me at my first job. I&rsquo;m sure most developers go through it one day or another. I was assigned a new task involving technologies I did not know. I did not have the guts to state upfront that I would have to learn them. The result was that I sent 2 full weeks fiddling with this task to get something working. The more it went on, the more the product people were wondering why it was taking so long, and the more I got stressed !</p>

<h2>Be bold and say No !</h2>

<p>If we are sure something we should not do something, we need to say so. Badass developers are not afraid to say they won&rsquo;t do it. <a href="/are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/">Good software engineering requires merciless prioritization</a>. If there are doubt about the value of doing something, it&rsquo;s often a better idea to make sure before wasting time on it.</p>

<p>There are many ways to say &lsquo;No&rsquo;. Before giving a harsh &lsquo;No&rsquo;, we can try to challenge decisions. We can ask for clarifications and rationals through open questions. Very often, highlighting the risks makes people review their plans. As technical experts, we should also share as much of the consequences as possible.</p>

<p>In the end, badass developers are ready to leave a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fubared">FUBARed</a> situation. Great engineers don&rsquo;t have troubles finding jobs these days &hellip; There&rsquo;s no reason they should accept to be waisting their time.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ In the end, badass developers are ready to leave a FUBARed situation</p></blockquote>

<h2>What do to next ?</h2>

<p>As we become badass developers, our reputation will grow. We&rsquo;ll be in a better position to negotiate a large scale refactoring with the business. There&rsquo;s a catch though : we&rsquo;ll need to live up to our reputation ! Admitting that we are wrong 100% with candor will not make it !Â </p>

<p>When we manage to negotiate a large scale refactoring, the team will need to do a good job of it. This boils down to delivering it piece by piece, alongside features. This is exactly what my <a href="http://eepurl.com/dxKE95">next post</a> will be about.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is a one sentence summary of my <a href="/why-we-need-badass-developers-to-perform-large-scale-refactorings/">previous post</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Badass developers negotiate large scale refactorings with the business better.</p></blockquote>

<p> Unfortunately, not all of us are sitting next to a true badass developer &hellip; Hopefully, we can all become one ! Depending on our track record, it&rsquo;s going to be more or less difficult, but with time and the good attitude, we can all do it. Becoming a badass developer is all about trustworthiness.</p>

<p>This post is the third in a <a href="/blog/categories/large-scale-refactoring-sponsorship-series/">series about how to get sponsorship for a large scale refactoring</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, I recommend you to start from <a href="/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to become trustworthy is to avoid things that kill trust. Sounds obvious, but it&rsquo;s very easy to forget. Here are 5 examples of trust killers you should never do if you want to become a badass developer.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-07-03-5-mistakes-badass-developers-never-do/mistake.jpg" alt="Drawing of a hurt finger after someone made a mistake with a hammer. Badass developer don't do this kind of mistakes !" /></p>

<h2>Resume Driven Development</h2>

<p>We should pick the best tools for the job. The best tools are often a bit old, precisely because they&rsquo;ve been battle tested in production for a while ! That&rsquo;s exactly the kind of technologies you want your business to rely on.</p>

<p>To keep his skills up to date, a badass developer will not add a funky new tech in the production code. He would rather negotiate <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">slack time</a> with the business. He might also openly <em>take</em> his Friday afternoons to experiment the latest techs ! He would simply explain that it&rsquo;s to avoid polluting the production system.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ A badass developer will not add a funky new tech in the production code.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Over-engineering</h2>

<p>Gold plating or over-engineering are similar anti-patterns. A badass developer always keeps the business&rsquo;s interest in mind. This means he knows how to balance long term design and short term features. A good rule of thumb is to keep a vision in sight, but to get there in baby steps.</p>

<h2>Build features with no agreed upon value</h2>

<p>Product managers are here to select what should and what should not be in the product. As product experts, they are the ones who know how much a feature is worth. Except (maybe) when we are building tools for others developers, they know better than us. Adding something of dubious value in the product is bad in two ways.Â </p>

<ul>
<li>First, it takes some time to build, time that we could use to build valuable features instead. Remember : <a href="/real-developers-ship/">Real developers ship</a> !</li>
<li>Second, it creates unnecessary code to maintain. In the worst case, it can <a href="/incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/">constraint the architecture</a>. Which might eventually prevent us from adding other more valuable features afterwards.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Hide in a tunnel</h2>

<p>We should always be careful of the tunnel effect. Seeing their money vanishing with no visible output makes business people, understandably, creepy. As soon as things become too complicated, a badass developer will raise the alarm. The fact is that he has been in this kind of situation before, and knows how to recognize it. At that point, it&rsquo;s still possible to discuss the problem with everyone, and adjust the plan.</p>

<p>As an interesting side note, I was at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/DDD-Paris/">Paris DDD Meetup</a> last Thursday. We had the chance to welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/ericevans0">Eric Evans</a> as a surprise guest ! When asked what were his worst mistakes, he said something along this line :</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Some of my biggest mistakes were not backtracking soon enough a few times as I was drifting in quagmire. Eric Evans</p></blockquote>

<h2>Let the team down</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not only about getting the business&rsquo;s trust. We must also build trust from our fellow developers. Whenever we break the build and leave, or worse, deploy and leave, that trust is gone for a long while&hellip; We should not do that !</p>

<h2>There&rsquo;s more to a badass developer</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m done with this list of things badass developers don&rsquo;t do. Avoiding these is only the first step to become a badass developer. In <a href="/principles-that-will-make-you-become-a-badass-developer/">next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll write about what we need to do if we want to build strong trust with the business.</p>
