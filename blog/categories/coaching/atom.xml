    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, my colleague <a href="https://ahmadatwi.me/">Ahmad Atwi</a> and I went to the London <a href="https://www.spaconference.org/spa2017/">SPA Conference</a> to give our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJsukJhxt7E">Remote eXtreme Practice</a> talk.</p>

<p>The London <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> is one of the most active in the world. You could feel an XP atmosphere at the conference. For example, people like <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/">Nat Pryce</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sf105">Steve Freeman</a>, authors of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321503627&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pbourgau-20&amp;linkId=fcdd83a07a3cfb190f2c8e7e8b9f72c3">GOOSGT</a> book were speakers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321503627&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pbourgau-20&amp;linkId=fcdd83a07a3cfb190f2c8e7e8b9f72c3"><img src="../imgs/2017-07-06-5-spa-conference-takeaways-that-could-make-us-better-software-professionals/growing.jpg" alt="The cover of Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided By Tests" /></a></p>

<p>To summarize, we had the chance to attend a lot of very interesting sessions during the 3 days of the conference. Here are 5 pearls of wisdom I took back with me.</p>

<h2>What connascences are</h2>

<p>Identifying code <a href="http://connascence.io/">connascences</a> helps to rank refactorings and keep the system maintainable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/refactor.html">Continuous refactoring</a> is one of the core practices of XP. For me, knowing what to refactor next has been a matter of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html">code smells</a>, discussing with my pair and gut feeling.</p>

<p>A connascence is a coupling between parts of the system. Two parts of your code are connascent if changing one implies changing the other. For example, a function call is connascent by name with the function definition. If you change one, you need to change the other.</p>

<p>Connascences are more formal than code smells. We can detect and rank them to pick the most important refactoring to do. People have listed 9 types of connascences. Some are visible in the source code, others are dynamic and difficult to spot before runtime.</p>

<p>The lowest form of connascence is <a href="http://connascence.io/name.html">&lsquo;of name&rsquo;,</a> like in the function call example above. The worst form is <a href="http://connascence.io/identity.html">&lsquo;of Identity&rsquo;</a>, when different parts of the system must reference the same object.</p>

<p>The higher the connascence, the more difficult it is to evolve the parts involved. Instead of relying on intuition, you can use a connascence based refactoring algorithm :</p>

<ol>
<li>Detect the highest connascence</li>
<li>Reduce or remove it</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>


<p>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/xpsurgery">Kevin Rutherford</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mowat27">Adrian Mowat</a> for your <a href="http://xpsurgery.com/resources/connascence-hunt-slides/">Red Green then what ?</a> session about connascence.</p>

<h2>Tips for pairing with junior developers</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/irinatsyganok">Irina Tsyganok</a> and <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/">Nat Pryce</a> gave a very fun session about this topic. A lot of valuable points discussed, from which I saved a few pearls of wisdom.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cat eating session from <a href="https://twitter.com/natpryce">@natpryce</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/spaconf17?src=hash">#spaconf17</a> (unless <a href="https://twitter.com/irinatsyganok">@irinatsyganok</a> stops him) <a href="https://t.co/XSiaPDp9kJ">pic.twitter.com/XSiaPDp9kJ</a></p>&mdash; Andy Longshaw (@andylongshaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/andylongshaw/status/879714743963054080">27 juin 2017</a></blockquote>


<script async src="http://philippe.bourgau.net//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>It was reassuring to hear Nat saying that &ldquo;As we gain experience, we are not expected to know everything&rdquo;. Pairing with developers out of college is an occasion to &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; skills. Hard learned design skills versus updates on the latest technologies.</p>

<p>I also learned about the <a href="http://actingcoachscotland.co.uk/blog/expert-induced-amnesia/">Expert&rsquo;s Amnesia</a> and why experts often have a hard time teaching. Expert level knowledge is by nature instinctive. At this level of skill, it becomes very difficult to detail the logic of things that seem obvious.</p>

<h2>We engineers are more mentors than coaches</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201616416/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201616416&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pbourgau-20&amp;linkId=dc2f9dc4f5ca106842921bfded07b405">first XP book</a>, there were only 3 roles in the team : team members, on site customer and XP coach. The XP coach should be a developer who can help the team to learn the practices and principles of XP.</p>

<p>About the same time, the personal or professional coach jobs appeared. The Scrum Master, is to Scrum what the XP coach is to XP, without the developer part. Remember the joke &ldquo;Scrum is like XP, without everything that makes it work&rdquo; (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html">Flaccid Scrum</a>).</p>

<p>It looks like the Agile Coach job title appeared out of all this. The problem is no one exactly knows what this is. Should he be an experienced developer like the XP coach ? A great people person ? Or someone good at introducing change ? or a mix of these ?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.selfishprogramming.com/about/">Portia Tung</a> and <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/helenlisowski">Helen Lisowski</a> &rsquo;s Â talk &ldquo;The power of coaching&rdquo; clarified that.</p>

<p>There is no knowledge transfer from the coach to the coachees ! On the other side, a mentor does transfer knowledge to his mentees. The coach helps his coachee take a step back and take decisions in full consciousness. The goal of the mentor is to inspire and train to new techniques.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fine being a mentor and not a coach ;&ndash;)</p>

<h2>Servant leaders need to be tough at times</h2>

<p>We hear a lot about servant leadership nowadays. Scrum Master should be servant leaders, as well as managers in agile organizations.</p>

<p><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/company/bellebeck-limited">Angie Main</a> gave a very interesting session about servant leadership. She made an interesting point I had not heard about before. We all know that servant leaders should trust the team to get the work done most of the time. In spite of that, servant leaders must also be ready to step in and remove people who don&rsquo;t fit in and endanger the team !</p>

<p>This reminded me of what Jim Collins says in <a href="http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Built_to_Last#Chapter_6_.E2.80.93_Cult-like_Cultures">Built to last</a> : &ldquo;People who don&rsquo;t fit are expelled like viruses !&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060516402/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060516402&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pbourgau-20&amp;linkId=e83ad8e3dcf7bdb7f875d5b22e8eb4c6"><img src="../imgs/2017-07-06-5-spa-conference-takeaways-that-could-make-us-better-software-professionals/built-to-last.jpg" alt="The cover of Built to Last" /></a></p>

<h2>1/3000 ideas succeeds</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ozzieyuce">Ozlem Yuce</a>&rsquo;s session, I learned about the &ldquo;Job To Be Done&rdquo; technique to understand the customer&rsquo;s real needs.</p>

<p>Studies measured that only 1 idea out of 3000 ends up as a successful product ! <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=56217976614325233f8b4567&amp;assetKey=AS%3A285916150157312%401445179130594">Here</a> seems to be the original research.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll remember this fact next time I&rsquo;m ask for a funky feature !</p>

<h2>To conclude</h2>

<p>At the end, we had a very good time at SPAconference. The talks were insightful, we had interesting discussions, the premises were comfortable and on top of that, food was great !</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m already eager to go to SPA conference 2018 !</p>

    <updated>2016-11-03T05:41:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-kill-scrum-zombies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First of all, what is that ? Usually, Scrum zombies go in groups, and quite often, you&rsquo;ll find a full team of them :</p>

<p>A typical team of Scrum Zombies follows Scrum pretty well, does all the ceremonies, adopted good engineering practices, and might even be delivering OK. But all the fun is gone, everyone is on autopilot, no continuous improvement is happening anymore, retrospectives are dull and repetitive &hellip; There&rsquo;s a gut feeling in the air that sooner or later, the project will miss a turn.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-11-03-how-to-kill-scrum-zombies/sad-fans.jpg" title="A team of sad fans, looking like lost zombies" ></p>

<p>Sounds familiar ?</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s going on exactly ?</h2>

<p>When dev teams want to get more (agile|lean|reactive|.*) they often resort to hiring a full time coach. At first, a coach can have a great impact on the team. He will unblock change, show different ways of getting things done and train the team to new practices. Once all this is done, the coach becomes like any team member, or sometimes just leaves. That&rsquo;s the point when the team, as a whole, has to take on responsibility for continuous improvement.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s needed then ?</h2>

<p>The team needs to be able to conduct their own experiments and improvements. For this, they need divergent thinking, or creativity, or thinking out of the box; name it as you prefer. In a complex world, no single individual can bring all the answers to all the upcoming issues any team will face. Once the coach has put in place the practices necessary to continuous improvement, it&rsquo;s up to the team.</p>

<p>Unlike what the common idea says, creativity does not come out of thin air, it is cultivated !</p>

<h3>Diversity in the team</h3>

<p>Diversity does not mean minority quotas in your team. Diversity means diversity of interest, of way of thinking, of mentality, of way of working &hellip; The more diverse your team members, the more likely they&rsquo;ll find innovative ways to work out of their current problems.</p>

<h3>Slack</h3>

<p>Removing any slack from the planning is the surest way to kill creativity and innovation. Great ideas often come at unexpected moments (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1478151003&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=pragmatic+thinking+and+learning">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware</a>) because the mind works in the background to find them. You want to leave some time for that.</p>

<h3>Go to conferences</h3>

<p>Creativity builds on creativity. Great ideas are often adaptations of one or many existing ones. Going to conferences is a great way to collect a lot of ideas !</p>

<h3>Share trainings and lectures</h3>

<p>Different people might react differently to the same information. When a team member finishes reading a book or comes back from a training, it&rsquo;s a great idea to have him present what he learned to the others. This will reinforce his own learning, but it might also trigger new ideas in his team mates.</p>

<h3>A dash of turnover</h3>

<p>Too much turnover can be fatal to a team, but not having any will bring other kind of problems too. Newcomers will challenge the status-quo, and the &ldquo;this is how it&rsquo;s done here&rdquo; motto won&rsquo;t be enough for them. That&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s needed to trigger a sane re-examination of the current practices. Oh &hellip; and turnover between teams is fine too ! If your company is large enough, you don&rsquo;t need to hire or fire people to create turnover, just encourage them to move to other teams !</p>

<h2>The tricky part of complexity</h2>

<p>By leaving time for other things than just cranking out stories, life will come back into the project, and zombies should go away. But wait, there&rsquo;s even more !</p>

<p>Software projects are pretty complex beasts. One of the most counter-intuitive thing with these complex system is that they make planning very difficult. Focusing too much on your main goal might be slowing you down !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-11-03-how-to-kill-scrum-zombies/large-tunnels-in-a-mine.jpg" title="Crossroad of large tunnels in a mine" ></p>

<p>In the face of complexity your project landscape is like a maze of tunnels ! Who said you&rsquo;re choosing the best ones ? By keeping free time to explore other, seemingly unrelated, topics you might discover opportunities that will remove a lot of the work to get to your final destination !</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/"/>
    <updated>2016-05-06T04:04:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re doing pair programming almost all the the time in our team. A few weeks ago, we went to <a href="http://www.devoxx.fr/">Devoxx</a> Paris, and 2 team mates used pair programming at a hands on session : they finished way before the others and had the time to take a 30 minute break. Pair programming delivers more &hellip; when it works.</p>

<h2>Flavors of Pair Programming</h2>

<p>Throughout our experience, we have identified some situations where it does or does not work :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Pain Zone         </th>
<th> Skill Zone</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Wandering buddies </td>
<td> Mates</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expert / Novice   </td>
<td> Mentor &amp; Apprentice</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br>


<h2>The Pain Zone</h2>

<p>Pair programming can be painful. It can feel like a waste of time or extremely frustrating. Here are the typical situations and how to fix them.</p>

<h3>The Wandering Buddies</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/going_nowhere.jpg" title="A &lsquo;going nowhere&rsquo; sign" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d get if you asked to newcomers straight out of school to pair program on existing source code on day 1. They&rsquo;d be dabbling here and there, without going anywhere. Each one would try to get the keyboard to try his way, but in the end, no general direction would be followed.</p>

<p>The cure in this case (as often) is to stop and think. At least one in the pair needs to lean how to pair program. It&rsquo;s not difficult, that&rsquo;s just :</p>

<ul>
<li>Discuss and agree on a general plan first</li>
<li>Keep a todo list</li>
<li>Track your advancement on your todo list while you don&rsquo;t have the keyboard</li>
<li>Stop and discuss from time to time</li>
</ul>


<p>By starting that, the pair will quickly move into the &lsquo;mates&rsquo; state.</p>

<h3>The Export / The Novice</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/race.jpg" title="A race where Usain Bolt leave everyone meters behind" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when a &lsquo;lone wolf kind of&rsquo; expert pairs with a junior. The expert picks the keyboard, dashes through the tasks, doesn&rsquo;t make sure his pair follows (which usually means it does not).</p>

<p>Regular pair programming means a change in job responsibilities for such expert programmers. If they were expert doers before, they should now become expert mentors or coaches. That&rsquo;s quite a difference. To them, it means that their goal must be to make his pair finish the task &hellip; It can be very frustrating at first. Nevertheless, the overall skill level in teams doing that increases so fast that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very fulfilling for the team as a whole.</p>

<h2>The Skill Zone</h2>

<p>The is where we want to be. When it happens, pair programming feels productive, interesting and fulfilling. Contrary to what is often thought, this can happen whatever the skill levels of the 2 programmers.</p>

<h3>The Mates</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/to-do-list.jpg" title="A Todo list" ></p>

<p>The programmers have equivalent skills on the subject at hand. They organized in a way that they are both learning from each other. By having to verbalize what and why they are doing things, by challenging each others assumptions and by sometimes doing differently than what they&rsquo;d alone.</p>

<h3>The Mentor &amp; The Apprentice</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/help.jpg" title="People helping each other to climb a mountain" ></p>

<p>Other times, there can be a real difference in skills for what the pair is attempting to do. In this situation, the goal of the most knowledgeable is to train his pair, who&rsquo;s goal is to learn. The task becomes some kind of exercise on which to practice.</p>

<p>During a typical pairing session, a pair might switch many times between mentor and mates states. Each one in the pair might assume the mentor&rsquo;s role for different aspect of the work. At the end of the day, everyone should feel as if they had learned and accomplished good work.</p>

<h2>Last Word of Caution</h2>

<p>Pair programming is exhausting. Don&rsquo;t expect to be able to do 40 hours of pair programming per week. After 6 hours in a day, one usually starts to get a lot less efficient.</p>

<p>Both juniors and experienced programmers also need some time by their own, to experiment things by themselves or to complete a simple task without having worry about explaining everything.</p>

<p>These are the reasons why <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</a> stresses having a sustainable pace and leaving space for <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack time</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just discovered a hack to spread agile (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> by the way) through an organization. It works provided :</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a BDD testing expert in your team</li>
<li>Your team is using the work of another software team from your company</li>
</ul>


<p>If this team does not use agile practices, they are likely to regularly create regressions or to be late at providing new versions.</p>

<p>Use your client role in the relation, and propose your help ! Spend some time with them to help them put automated customer tests in place. Be genuinely nice with them, show example, be available and, obviously, bring improvement. With some chance, they might soon be asking for more.</p>

When you can help
Then DO IT !
