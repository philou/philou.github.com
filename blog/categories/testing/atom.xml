    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are sometimes tempted to use mocks to shortcut test data initialization. Unfortunately, excessive mocking makes tests difficult to maintain. As <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/05/05/TestDefinitions.html">Uncle Bob explained</a>, it&rsquo;s a road that leads to giving up on tests.</p>

<p>Hopefully, <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builders</a> both shortcut test data setup and avoid mocks.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-05-01-how-to-use-test-data-builders-to-avoid-mocks-and-keep-your-tests-clear/crate.jpg" alt="Drawing of a crate" /></p>

<p>This is the fourth post <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">of a series about how to avoid mocks</a> in automated tests. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, I recommend you to start from <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<h2>The problem with test data initialization</h2>

<p>Setting up the correct state for automated tests can be pretty verbose. This is especially true for software in complex domains or code with a lot of side effects.</p>

<p>The situation gets worse as tests need to setup similar but not exactly identical data. What I often see in code bases is a lot of test data setup duplication. For example, here are tests for a basic ticketing system.</p>

<p>```ruby
require &lsquo;rspec&rsquo;
require &lsquo;date&rsquo;</p>

<p>describe &lsquo;Ticket Tracking&rsquo; do
  context &ldquo;with test setup duplication&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>it 'latest change date is the creation date when nothing changed' do
  creation_time = DateTime.new(2018,4,26,13,9,0)

  ticket = Ticket.new("Widget broken", "The widget is not loading when ...", "Philippe", creation_time)

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(creation_time)
end

it 'latest change date is the comment date when a comment is written' do
  ticket = Ticket.new("Widget broken", "The widget is not loading when ...", "Philippe", DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 9, 0))
  comment_time = DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 16, 0)

  ticket.add_comment(Comment.new("Should work now", "Dan", comment_time))

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(comment_time)
end

it 'latest change date is the comment date of the latest comment' do
  ticket = Ticket.new("Widget broken", "The widget is not loading when ...", "Philippe", DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 9, 0))
  ticket.add_comment(Comment.new("Should work now", "Dan", DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 16, 0)))
  comment_time = DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 18, 36, 0)

  ticket.add_comment(Comment.new("Should work now", "Dan", comment_time))

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(comment_time)
  end

it 'latest change date is time of latest change if after comment' do
  creation_time = DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 9, 0)
  ticket = Ticket.new("Widget broken", "The widget is not loading when ...", "Philippe", creation_time)
  ticket.add_comment(Comment.new("Should work now", "Dan", DateTime.new(2017, 4, 26, 13, 16, 0)))

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(creation_time)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h2>The code under test</h2>

<h1>#</h1>

<p>class Ticket</p>

<p>  def initialize(title, description, reporter, creation_time)</p>

<pre><code>@updated_at = creation_time
@comments = []
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def latest_change</p>

<pre><code>([@updated_at] + @comments.map(&amp;:created_at)).max
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def add_comment(comment)</p>

<pre><code>@comments.push(comment)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>class Comment
  attr_reader :created_at
  def initialize(message, author, time)</p>

<pre><code>@created_at = time
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that there&rsquo;s a huge amount of duplication in the tests data setups.</p>

<p>The straightforward fix against that is method extraction. This is the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html">Object Mother pattern</a>. Unfortunately, Object Mother breaks down under the number of variations. Every time you need a new change, you&rsquo;ll add a parameter to the Object Mother method. Long story short, you&rsquo;ll end up with code like that :</p>

<p>```ruby
describe &lsquo;Ticket Tracking&rsquo; do
  context &ldquo;with object mother&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>it 'latest change date is the creation date when nothing changed' do
  creation_time = DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 5, 0)
  ticket = create_ticket(creation_time, [])

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(creation_time)
end

it 'latest change date is the comment date when a comment is written' do
  comment_time = DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 16, 0)
  ticket = create_ticket(DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 9, 0), [comment_time])

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(comment_time)
end

it 'latest change date is the comment date of the latest comment' do
  comment_time = DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 18, 36, 0)
  ticket = create_ticket(DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 9, 0),
                         [DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 16, 0), comment_time])

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(comment_time)
end

it 'latest change date is time of latest change if after comment' do
  creation_time = DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 9, 0)
  ticket = create_ticket(creation_time,[DateTime.new(2017, 4, 26, 13, 16, 0)])

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(creation_time)
end

def create_ticket(creation_time, comment_times)
  ticket = Ticket.new("Widget broken", "The widget is not loading when ...", "Philippe", creation_time)
  comment_times.each do |comment_time|
    ticket.add_comment(Comment.new("Should work now", "Dan", comment_time))
  end
  return ticket
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>As you can see, we have less duplication, but the tests got both unreadable and intricate &hellip; Following <a href="/how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/">my advices</a> and using more <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Immutable Value Objects</a> makes the situation worse ! When data is mutable, we can customize it after the call to the Object Mother method. If data is immutable, it all has to be setup at initialization &hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when the mock temptation strikes. Sometimes it&rsquo;s so much easier to mock a method rather than to initialize your data properly. It can be 1 line of mock instead of dealing with all this mess.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 If you are not careful, messy test initialization code will trick you into using mocks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Suppose we now want to make sure we can&rsquo;t add comments that were written before the ticket was created. We&rsquo;ll add the following</p>

<p>```ruby
describe &lsquo;Ticket Tracking&rsquo; do
  # &hellip;
  it &ldquo;is not possible to insert a comment before creation data&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>ticket = create_ticket(DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 9, 0), [])
expect do
  ticket.add_comment(Comment.new("Should work now", "Dan", DateTime.new(2017, 4, 26, 13, 9, 0)))
end.to raise_error(ArgumentError)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h1>&hellip;</h1>

<p>class Ticket
  # &hellip;
  def add_comment(comment)</p>

<pre><code>raise ArgumentError unless @updated_at &lt; comment.created_at

@comments.push(comment)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  # &hellip;
end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one test (<code>latest change date is time of latest change if after comment</code>) where we were doing just this, will now fail. The fix would be to find a real situation for this test. Here this could be that the ticket is modified after the latest comment. If the tests are too messy though, a mock can be a quick and dirty fix the setup and make the test pass :</p>

<p>```ruby
it &lsquo;latest change date is time of latest change if after comment&rsquo; do
  creation_time = DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 9, 0)
  ticket = create_ticket(creation_time, [])
  comment = Comment.new(&ldquo;Should work now&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dan&rdquo;, DateTime.new(2018, 4, 26, 13, 16, 0))
  ticket.add_comment(comment)
  allow(comment).to receive(:created_at).and_return(DateTime.new(2017, 4, 26, 13, 16, 0))</p>

<p>  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(creation_time)
end
```</p>

<p>There is a third way : Test Data Builders</p>

<h2>What are test data builders</h2>

<p>As often, when design is not satisfying, adding an indirection solves the issue. Here the indirection takes shape of the Builder pattern.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Builder Pattern [</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern"><em>Wikipedia</em></a><em>] :</em></p>

<p>The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so the same construction process can create different representations.</p></blockquote>

<p>The idea is to use the builder pattern to build the test data. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525160355&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests</a> covers this technique in great length.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525160355&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests"><img src="../imgs/2018-05-01-how-to-use-test-data-builders-to-avoid-mocks-and-keep-your-tests-clear/growing.jpg" alt="Cover of the book Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests" /></a></p>

<p>Here is the previous code re-written using the test data builder pattern.</p>

<p>```ruby
require &lsquo;rspec&rsquo;
require &lsquo;date&rsquo;</p>

<p>describe &lsquo;Ticket Tracking&rsquo; do
  context &ldquo;with test data builders&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>before :each do
  @t = date_times.build
end

it 'latest change date is the creation date when nothing changed' do
  ticket = a_ticket.at(@t[0]).build

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(@t[0])
end

it 'latest change date is the comment date when a comment is written' do
  ticket = a_ticket
               .at(@t[0])
               .with_comment(a_comment.at(@t[1]))
               .build

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(@t[1])
end

it 'latest change date is the comment date of the latest comment' do
  ticket = a_ticket
               .at(@t[0])
               .with_comment(a_comment.at(@t[1]))
               .with_comment(a_comment.at(@t[2]))
               .build

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(@t[2])
end

it 'latest change date is time of latest change if after comment' do
  ticket = a_ticket.at(@t[0])
               .with_comment(a_comment.at(@t[1]))
               .build

  ticket.update_description("The widget is not loading when logged in as anonymous", @t[2])

  expect(ticket.latest_change).to be(@t[2])
end

it "is not possible to insert a comment before creation data" do
  ticket = a_ticket.at(@t[1]).build

  expect do
    ticket.add_comment(a_comment.at(@t[0]).build)
  end.to raise_error(ArgumentError)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h2>Test Data Builders</h2>

<h1>#</h1>

<p>class DateTimeBuilder
  def build</p>

<pre><code>seed = DateTime.now
(0..10).map {|i| seed + i}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
def date_times()
  DateTimeBuilder.new
end</p>

<p>class CommentBuilder
  def initialize</p>

<pre><code>@at = DateTime.now
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  def at(time)</p>

<pre><code>@at = time
self
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  def build</p>

<pre><code>Comment.new("Should work now", "Dan", @at)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
def a_comment()
  CommentBuilder.new
end</p>

<p>class TicketBuilder
  def initialize</p>

<pre><code>@at = DateTime.now
@comments = []
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  def at(time)</p>

<pre><code>@at = time
self
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  def with_comment(comment_builder)</p>

<pre><code>@comments.push(comment_builder.build)
self
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  def build</p>

<pre><code>ticket = Ticket.new("Widget broken", "The widget is not loading when ...", "Philippe", @at)
@comments.each do |comment|
  ticket.add_comment(comment)
end
ticket
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
def a_ticket()
  TicketBuilder.new
end</p>

<h2>The code under test</h2>

<h1>#</h1>

<p>class Ticket</p>

<p>  def initialize(title, description, reporter, creation_time)</p>

<pre><code>@updated_at = creation_time
@comments = []
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def latest_change</p>

<pre><code>([@updated_at] + @comments.map(&amp;:created_at)).max
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def add_comment(comment)</p>

<pre><code>raise ArgumentError unless @updated_at &lt; comment.created_at

@comments.push(comment)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def update_description(description, update_time)</p>

<pre><code>@updated_at = update_time
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>class Comment
  attr_reader :created_at</p>

<p>  def initialize(message, author, time)</p>

<pre><code>@created_at = time
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>As you can see, it provides default test values, and we only need to provide the custom values we care about. This makes the test code both readable and intention revealing. Making the tests more understandable helps a lot to find ways to avoid mocks. Here, we replaced the mock on the comment time by an update to the ticket after the last comment.</p>

<p>The pattern applies in many languages, even if implementations will be different. In Ruby, libraries like <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot">factory_bot</a> avoid a lot of boilerplate code. Have a look at <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000769.html">this article</a> for examples in Java.</p>

<h2>Other advantages</h2>

<p>Test data builders have another second effect benefit. When setting up the data is complicated, we are likely to add more that one assertion in a test. Unit tests can end up looking like a mini scenario to avoid duplicating this test setup.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to create a specific tests for every assertion with Test Data Builders. By doing so we get smaller and more focused tests, which bring :</p>

<ul>
<li>Better names for tests</li>
<li>More readable tests</li>
<li>Faster diagnostic of the problem when a particular test fails</li>
<li>🎁 Better coverage ! In a large test, all assertions work on the same input values. When we have many small tests, we can use a different value in each.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 By simplifying the creation of new tests with different data, Test Data Builders increase code coverage in the long term!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Next week</h2>

    <updated>2018-05-03T19:28:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/immutable-value-objects-vs-mocks-fizz-buzz</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/">previous post</a> I explained how <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Immutable Value Objects</a> help us to avoid mocks. In this post, I&rsquo;ll illustrate this in practice with real code.</p>

<p>This is the third post on a <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">series about how to avoid mocks</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, you can start reading the full story <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-04-17-immutable-value-objects-vs-mocks-fizz-buzz/immutable-fizz-buzz.jpg" alt="A drawing &quot;FIZZ BUZZ&quot; rock fallen and sealed in the ground" /></p>

<h2>Fizz Buzz Example</h2>

<p>As a simple example, I&rsquo;ll go through the classic <a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/">Fizz Buzz</a>. I&rsquo;ve implemented and tested it with and without immutable value objects. Please keep in mind that this is a toy example, where problems are obvious and easily fixed. I try to highlight at small scale the same problems that get hidden by the complexity of a large scale program.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a typical FizzBuzz implementation.</p>

<p>```ruby
1.upto(100) do |i|
  if (i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>STDOUT.puts("FizzBuzz\n")
</code></pre>

<p>  elsif (i%3 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>STDOUT.puts("Fizz\n")
</code></pre>

<p>  elsif (i%5 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>STDOUT.puts("Buzz\n")
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>STDOUT.puts("#{i}\n")
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Suppose you need to add some tests around the code. The most straightforward way is to mock <code>STDOUT</code> :</p>

<p>```ruby
require &lsquo;rspec&rsquo;</p>

<p>def fizzBuzz(max, out)
  1.upto(max) do |i|</p>

<pre><code>if (i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0)
  out.puts("FizzBuzz\n")
elsif (i%3 == 0)
  out.puts("Fizz\n")
elsif (i%5 == 0)
  out.puts("Buzz\n")
else
  out.puts("#{i}\n")
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h1>main</h1>

<p>fizzBuzz(100,STDOUT)</p>

<p>describe &lsquo;Mockist Fizz Buzz&rsquo; do</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print numbers, fizz and buzz&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>out = double("out")
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("1\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("2\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Fizz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("4\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Buzz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Fizz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("7\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("8\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Fizz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Buzz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("11\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("Fizz\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("13\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("14\n").ordered
expect(out).to receive(:puts).with("FizzBuzz\n").ordered

fizzBuzz(15, out)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are a few problems with this code :</p>

<ul>
<li>With nested logic and complicated mock setup, both code and tests aren&rsquo;t very readable</li>
<li>They both seem to violate the single responsibility principle as well</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s depending on a mutable output. Within a larger program, something could be messing around with this output stream. That would break FizzBuzz.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s now try to use as many immutable values objects as possible, and see what happens to the mocks.</p>

<p>```ruby
require &lsquo;rspec&rsquo;</p>

<h1>We extracted a function to do the fizz buzz on a single number</h1>

<p>def fizzBuzzN(i)
  if (i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>"FizzBuzz"
</code></pre>

<p>  elsif (i%3 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>"Fizz"
</code></pre>

<p>  elsif (i%5 == 0)</p>

<pre><code>"Buzz"
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>i.to_s
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h1>We replaced the many calls to STDOUT.puts by building a single</h1>

<h1>large (and immutable) string</h1>

<p>def fizzBuzz(max)
  ((1..max).map {|i| fizzBuzzN(i)}).join(&ldquo;\n&rdquo;)
end</p>

<h1>main, with a single call to STDOUT.puts</h1>

<p>STDOUT.puts fizzBuzz(100)</p>

<p>describe &lsquo;Statist Fizz Buzz&rsquo; do</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print numbers not multiples of 3 or 5&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(fizzBuzzN(1)).to eq("1")
expect(fizzBuzzN(2)).to eq("2")
expect(fizzBuzzN(4)).to eq("4")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print Fizz for multiples of 3&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(fizzBuzzN(3)).to eq("Fizz")
expect(fizzBuzzN(6)).to eq("Fizz")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print Buzz for multiples of 5&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(fizzBuzzN(5)).to eq("Buzz")
expect(fizzBuzzN(10)).to eq("Buzz")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print FizzBuzz for multiples of 3 and 5&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(fizzBuzzN(15)).to eq("FizzBuzz")
expect(fizzBuzzN(30)).to eq("FizzBuzz")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;should print numbers, fizz and buzz&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(fizzBuzz(15)).to start_with("1\n2\nFizz").and(end_with("14\nFizzBuzz"))
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>As we can see, using immutable value objects got us rid of the mocks. Obviously, this new code will not be as efficient as the original version, but most of the time, this does not matter. As a bonus though we get finer grain and more readable tests.</p>

<h3>Other testing advantages</h3>

<p>Appart from preventing mocks, Immutable Value Objects have other advantages related to testing.</p>

<ul>
<li>We can directly assert their equality, without having to dig into their guts</li>
<li>We can call methods as many times as we want, without the risk of changing anything and breaking the tests</li>
<li>Immutable Value Objects are a lot less likely to contain invalid state. This removes the need for a whole range of validity tests.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 Immutable Value Objects simplify testing in many ways.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Convincing your teammates</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that Immutable Value Objects have a ton of advantages when testing. People have found that they also have many other benefits :</p>

</ul>


<p>Surprisingly though, it&rsquo;s difficult to persuade programmers to use more immutability. It&rsquo;s tricky to explain why returning a modified copy is simpler than just adding a setter.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Why is it so hard to persuade other developers to use immutable data structures ?</p></blockquote>

<p>I had the most success by far when encountering a bug resulting of share mutable state. When this happens, the long term benefits and safety of the immutable design wins people over. The good thing is that as you convince more people in the team, immutability will spread like a virus !</p>

<p>Outside of this situation, you might try some of the following arguments to move people :</p>

<ul>
<li>Immutable values prevent bugs caused by different parts of the system changing the same mutable state</li>
<li>They make it easier to deal with the program in smaller parts and to reason about the system in general</li>
<li>Immutable values don&rsquo;t need any synchronization and make multithreaded programming easier</li>
<li>When tempted to add a simple setter instead of keeping a class immutable, highlight the stressful debugging time to come</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re dealing with a Design By Contract adept, explain how <a href="/almost-15-years-of-using-design-by-contract/">immutability has it built-in</a></li>
<li>Admit that mainstream languages have bad support for Immutable Value. Point to patterns like <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/immutability-with-builder-design-pattern">Data Builders</a> that work around these limitation</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many techniques to avoid mocks. Some of the most effective involve architecture changes. Unfortunately, there are not the most straightforward to use. Re-architecting involves people and time that you may not dispose of right now. In the following posts, I&rsquo;ll go over techniques that any developer can use in his day to day code to avoid mocks. These battle tested techniques that I&rsquo;ve used on different projects in the past. Check <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the previous post</a> if you&rsquo;re interested to learn how I came to use them.</p>

<p>This is the second post <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">of a series about how to avoid mocks</a> in automated tests. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, I recommend you to read my <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">first post</a> to understand the perils of mocks in more details.</p>

<p>The first mock fighting small-scale technique I&rsquo;ll go over is <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Immutable Value Objects</a>.</p>

<h2>What are Immutable Value Objects ?</h2>

<p>Behind this weird name is something very simple to understand. Immutable Value Objects :</p>

<ul>
<li>Cannot change their state after construction</li>
<li>Only depend on other Immutable Value Objects</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t change the state of the whole system in any way</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t do side effects, like inputs and outputs for example</li>
</ul>


<p>Eric Evans popularized the name in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523985269&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design">Domain-Driven Design Blue Book</a>. Immutable Value Objects have existed for decades in functional languages though. We say these objects are immutable (they cannot change) and pure (they cannot do side effects). Here are 2 interesting properties of Value Objects :</p>

<ul>
<li>you can call a method any number of times with no risk of changing anything to the system</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll always get the same result every time you call the same method on the same object</li>
</ul>


<p>These by itself, can already be handy when testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523985269&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design"><img src="../imgs/2018-04-17-how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/ddd.jpg" alt="Cover of Eric Evans's DDD book" /></a></p>

<h2>How do they prevent mocks ?</h2>

<p>That was a bit theoretical, so let&rsquo;s see how this helps to reduce mocking.</p>

<h3>Simpler &ldquo;init path&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take it the other way round and see how side effects can lead to mocking. Every test starts with setting the state in which to run the test. Side effects make this complicated, as many objects need to collaborate to set this state up. When this becomes too painful, people start hacking around with mocks. This in turn makes the tests more fragile :</p>

<ul>
<li>We are not testing a &ldquo;real&rdquo; situation</li>
<li>We need to keep this setup in line with the real code</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 Intricate state initialization encourage people to use mocks.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Isolates parts of the system</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, that is not all the story ! Mutable state also, tricks us into using mocks. As soon as your test deals with mutable state, there is a chance that this state is changed in the &lsquo;real&rsquo; system. This means that some bugs might &lsquo;escape&rsquo; unit tests and appear in end to end tests or in production. That&rsquo;s where the mocks strike ! In order to detect this bug in a fast feedback loop, we&rsquo;re likely to add larger scope tests and use mocks to speed them up &hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Mutable state and side effects make unit tests less effective.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Reduces code with side effects</h3>

<p>But there&rsquo;s another reason why Immutable Value Objects help us to avoid mocks. As we&rsquo;ll try to use them more and more for the previous two reasons, we&rsquo;ll need to adapt our programming style. As we&rsquo;ll push more and more code in Immutable Value Objects, the &lsquo;imperative&rsquo; part will shrink. This &lsquo;imperative&rsquo; part is where side-effect happen. This is the part where mocking out IOs makes sense. To summarize, the more Immutable Value Objects we use, the more isolated the IOs are, and the less mocking we need.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>💡 Mock hell : when excessive use of test mocks makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a> extremely slow or difficult.</p></blockquote>

<p>A few years ago, I managed to get a side project out of mock hell. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been using what I learned to avoid mocks in all the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on. This is the start of a series of posts about my mock-avoiding techniques.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-04-10-careless-mocking-considered-harmful/mocks-dont-rock.jpg" alt="A tag &quot;Mocks don't rock !&quot;" /></p>

<h2>Escape from Mock Hell</h2>

<p>Between 2010 and 2014, I was working on a side project I called <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses">http://mes-courses.fr</a>. Which actually means &ldquo;my house shopping&rdquo; in English. I wanted people to be able to do their house shopping in 5 minutes, by using a better UI for online groceries. I was using Ruby, and I had just read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523422024&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests</a>. I got a bit too excited with mocking, and was using it way too much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d been practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> for more than 5 years and I was expecting great results with a language like Ruby. After a few months though, I could feel that something was not going as well as it should. The test initialization code was getting longer and longer, as it included a lot of mock setup. This made the tests more complex and less readable. It also made them unreliable, as it was not rare for all my unit tests to pass while the system was not working. I was taking the habit of running my end to end test more and more often. I was also losing a lot of time maintaining the mock setup code in line with the real classes. Mocks also tricked me into the bad practice of keeping a 1 to 1 mapping between code and test files. That again increased my maintenance burden when moving code from one file to another.</p>

<p>It reached a point where I could not take it anymore. All these problems were pointing at mocks, so I tried to remove them from a test file. Here are the techniques I ended up using to remove them mocks : </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Objects</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builders</a></li>
<li><a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/custom-matchers">Test Matchers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Hexagonal architecture</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">In-memory fakes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wincent.com/wiki/Proxy_(test_double">Proxy doubles</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>The end result was beyond my hopes, as my problems almost magically disappeared. The code got simpler, I became a lot more confident about my unit tests, and they got easier to maintain. As an illustration, here is an excerpts from the diff of a rails controller test file which went through this mock diet.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/commit/2c9fce17f9b59d0b3828f309015c07b17cceddf4?diff=split"><img src="../imgs/2018-04-10-careless-mocking-considered-harmful/diff.jpg" alt="A screen capture of a Github diff showing a test file going on a mock diet" /></a></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the long term risk ?</h2>

<p>Basically, excessive mocking arms the maintainability of the tests. Here is what would have happened if I&rsquo;d done nothing. Tests would have become so painful to maintain that I would have started to ignore or delete them. As coverage would decrease, more and more code would become untested. That&rsquo;s exactly Michael Feathers' definition of Legacy Code :</p>

<blockquote><p>Legacy Code is code without tests. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523422039&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=legacy+code">Michael Feathers</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To summarize, excessive use of mocks leads to legacy code ! As most of us have learned the hard way, the further a system drifts into legacy, the lower the productivity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More than ever, the cheapest way to build a framework is to refactor it out of a specific app.</p>

<p><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> is a web development server side framework built in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>. It&rsquo;s been and remains very popular. It set the tone for all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a> web frameworks that followed. People have ported it to many other languages. Rails is now in it&rsquo;s 5th version, what is less known is how it was built in the first place.</p>

<h2>The story of Rails</h2>

<p><a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>, the creator of Rails, is a cult in the Ruby community. You can find the history of Rails at many places. If you have a bit of time, read <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/02/mf-signals/?currentPage=all">this great article</a> from Wired. If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of time, here is a summary.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried?lang=fr">Jason Fried</a> and DHH were working at <a href="https://37signals.com/">37signals</a>. They were working on project management app for small businesses called <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. After releasing the first version of Basecamp, DHH extracted and open sourced Rails out of it.</p>

<p>37signals later then re-used Rails to build other apps like Campfire, Highrise and Backpack.</p>

<p>We all know the end of the story, Rails adoption exploded. Many successful companies like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> have used it. It evolved a lot, through the darwinism of open source. Today, Rails might not be the latest and coolest web framework, but it is still very productive and popular.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-09-what-rails-teaches-us-about-building-platforms-and-frameworks/rails-logo.jpg" alt="The Rails logo" /></p>

<h2>Economic sense</h2>

<p>To summarize, here is how they did it :</p>

<ol>
<li>Built a specific app, and monetized it</li>
<li>Extracted an open source framework from it</li>
<li>Built other apps on the framework</li>
</ol>


<p>If you are not a programmers, you&rsquo;re likely to assume that the cost of reusing software is negligible. If you are a programmer, I&rsquo;ll ask you to assume that it is for a while.  Under this hypothesis, all they did makes a lot of business sense :</p>

<ul>
<li>Building a specific app first is the fastest path to paying customers. Building a framework first would need more work.</li>
<li>Once you have paying customers, you&rsquo;ve got money to fuel further work.</li>
<li>In particular, you have money to finance the extraction of an open source framework.</li>
<li>Putting the framework open source increases its reusability through bug reports and contributions.</li>
<li>Building the next app is even easier thanks to a mature framework and the revenues from the original app</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 Once you have paying customers, you&rsquo;ve got money to fuel further work.</p></blockquote>

<h2>How can it work ?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507610064&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rework"><img src="../imgs/2017-10-09-what-rails-teaches-us-about-building-platforms-and-frameworks/rework-cover.jpg" alt="Cover of Rework book" /></a></p>

<p>Ok, enough for common sense. Let&rsquo;s see what happens when you take into account the real cost of changing software ? All software developers know that changing software is far from cheap. Very often, it&rsquo;s more expensive to adapt than to rebuild</p>

<p>So how did the Rails guys manage it ? Rails has 3 specificities that explain that :</p>

<ul>
<li>Rails has automated testing built in and out</li>
<li>Basecamp guys are agile with a lower &lsquo;a&rsquo;. They don&rsquo;t follow Scrum or any method. Read <a href="https://basecamp.com/about/books">their books</a> and you&rsquo;ll understand how agile they are. They follow principles like KISS, YAGNI, Lean startup discovery &hellip;</li>
<li>Finally, it was open sourced !</li>
</ul>


<p>Agile principles and technical practices is what allowed them to take the common-sense path.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Thanks to agile practices, the cheapest way to build a framework is to extract it from a specific app.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Open question</h2>

<p>If it is possible to do the thing that makes the most economic sense, why isn&rsquo;t it the default way ? Why are so many of us still losing a ton of money writing large frameworks and platforms up-front ? How could we get large companies to adopt the more nimble &lsquo;basecamp&rsquo; way ?</p>
