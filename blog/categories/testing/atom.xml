    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the years doing some coding dojos with the same circle of people, I came up with my own style of practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>. Lately, I had the chance to do a pair programming session with someone I did not know. That made me realize that they are in fact even more ways to practice TDD than I thought.</p>

<h2>Mockist vs Classisist</h2>

<p>A lot has already been written (and discussed) about these two approaches. I myself have already <a href="/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">blogged</a> about the subject, I even gave a <a href="/how-not-to-use-mocks-my-talk-at-paris-rb/">talk</a> about it. From my own point of view, I believe that the inconvenients of making mocking the default far outweights the benefits. I&rsquo;m not saying that mocks aren&rsquo;t useful from time to time, but rather that they should remain the exception.</p>

<h2>Top-Down vs Bottom-Up</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s the reason why I wrote this post. This is the main difference I found between my style and my pair&rsquo;s. Let me explain.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-20-flavours-of-tdd/topdown-vs-bottomup.jpg" title="Top-Down vs Bottom-Up" ></p>

<h3>Top-Down</h3>

<p>Doing TDD top-down means starting with high level end to end tests, implementing the minimum to make it work, refactor and repeat. A bit like BDD, the point is to focus on the expected behavior, and avoid writing useless things. The bad point is that the refactoring part can get pretty difficult. On real life code, strictly following top-down would mean writing a feature test first, passing it with a quick and dirty implementation, to then spend hours trying to refactor all that mess &hellip; good luck !</p>

<p>Here is another example, from coding dojos this time. Having had success with the top-down approach during previous dojos, we once intentionally tried to code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#">Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life</a> using a top-down approach. We did so by writing high level tests that were checking special patterns (gliders &hellip;). That was a nightmare ! It felt like trying to reverse engineer the rules of the game from real use cases. It did not bring us anywhere.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-20-flavours-of-tdd/glider.gif" title="Conway&rsquo;s game of life gliders" ></p>

<h3>Bottom-Up</h3>

<p>At the other side of the spectrum, you can do bottom-up TDD. This means unit testing and implementing all the small bricks you think you&rsquo;ll need to provide the expected overall feature. The idea is to avoid tunnels and to get fast feedback on what you are coding. The bad side is that you might be coding something that will end up being unnecessary. Be careful, if you find yourself spending a lot of time building up utility classes, you might be doing too much bottom-up implementation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals">Numerals to Romans Kata</a> is a good exercise to fail at bottom-up. Every time I did this exercise during a coding dojo, people new to it would start to come up with complicated ways to do it (often involving complex array manipulation). Compared to that, applying disciplined bottom-up TDD brings a <a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Algorithm-Roman-Numeral-Converter">brutally effective solution for Numerals to Romans</a>.</p>

<h2>Mixed approach</h2>

<p>Both approaches have their pros and cons. I really believe developers who are serious about TDD should master both, and learn when to apply each. In fact, as often, the best approach lies somewhere in the middle. Here&rsquo;s my recipe :</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a high level feature test</li>
<li>try to make it pass &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; (usually) fail</li>
<li>rollback or shelve your test and draft implementation</li>
<li>build a brick</li>
<li>unshelve</li>
<li>try to make it pass &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; and so one until the high level test finally passes.</li>
</ol>


<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s a lot like the <a href="https://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/">Mikado Method</a> for building features instead of refactoring.</p>

<h2>Practice in dojos</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to intentionally practice this in coding dojos as well. Most kata should be OK, as long as the group agrees to fix it using this particular approach up front.</p>

<p>If during the dojo, you&rsquo;ve just written a test, suddenly realize that it won&rsquo;t be easy to get it passing, and that you&rsquo;ve got the elements spread out in your code, this is the time ! Comment the test, get the green bar, refactor, uncomment the test, try to make it pass, repeat &hellip; Eventually, you&rsquo;ll have all the bricks to make it easy to pass your test.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-20-flavours-of-tdd/cargo-cult.jpg" title="Cargo Cult : People thought that by building something that looks like a plane, they would be able to fly" ></p>

<p>Some might say this is not &lsquo;pure&rsquo; TDD, but that sounds like cargo cult to me ! As long as you make sure you are not building useless stuff, and that you keep the feedback loop as short as possible, you&rsquo;re on the right track.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-08-23-rspecproxies-now-supports-to-receive-xxx-dot-dot-dot-syntax/test_probes.jpg" title="Hardware test probes" ></p>

<p>Pure mocks are dangerous. They let defect go through, give a false sense of security and are difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already talked about it <a href="/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">before</a> but since then, <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">DHH announced that he was quitting TDD</a>, the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/">Is TDD Dead ?</a> debate took place, and the conclusion is that <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/mockists-are-dead-long-live-classicists">mockist are dead</a>.</p>

<p>They are still times when mocks feel much simpler than any other things. For example, imagine your process leaks and crashes after 10 hours, the fix is to pass an option to a thirdparty, how would you test this in a fast test ? That&rsquo;s exactly the kind of situation where using test proxies saves you from mocks. A test proxy defers everything to the real object but also features unintrusive hooks and probes that you can use in your test. If you want a code example, check <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/commit/2c9fce17f9b59d0b3828f309015c07b17cceddf4?diff=split">this commit</a>, where I refactored a rails controller test from mocks to a RSpecProxies (v0.1).</p>

<p>I created RSpecProxies <a href="/my-new-gem-for-creating-rspec-proxies/">a while ago</a>, a while ago, and it&rsquo;s syntax made it alien to the RSpec work, it needed an update. <a href="http://rspec.info">RSpec</a> now supports basic proxying with partial stubs, spies, the <code>and_call_original</code> and the <code>and_wrap_original</code> methods. <a href="https://github.com/philou/rspecproxies">RSpecProxies 1.0</a> is a collection of hooks built on top of these to make proxying easier, with a syntax that will be familiar to RSpec users.</p>

<h2>Before original hook</h2>

<p>This hook is triggered before a call a method. Suppose you want to simulate a bad connection :</p>

<p>```ruby
it &lsquo;can simulate unreliable connection&rsquo; do
  i = 0
  allow(Resource).to receive(:get).and_before_calling_original { |*args|</p>

<pre><code>i += 1
raise RuntimeError.new if i % 3 == 0
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  resources = Resource.get_at_least(10)</p>

<p>  expect(resources.size).to eq(10)
end
```</p>

<h2>After original hooks</h2>

<p>RSpecProxies provides the same kind of hook after the call :</p>

<p>``` ruby
it &lsquo;can check that the correct data is used (using and_after_calling_original&rsquo; do
  user = nil
  allow(User).to receive(:load).and_after_calling_original { |result| user = result }</p>

<p>  controller.login(&lsquo;joe&rsquo;, &lsquo;secret&rsquo;)</p>

<p>  expect(response).to include(user.created_at.to_s)
end
```</p>

<p>Here we are capturing the return value to use it later in the test. For this special purpose, RSpecProxies also provides 2 other helpers :</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>Store the latest result in @user of self</h1>

<p>allow(User).to receive(:load).and_capture_result_into(self, :user)</p>

<h1>Collect all results in the users array</h1>

<p>users = []
allow(User).to receive(:load).and_collect_results_into(users)
```</p>

<h2>Proxy chains</h2>

<p>RSpec mocks provides the <code>message_chain</code> feature to do build chains of stubs. RSpecProxy provides a very similar proxy chain concept. The main difference is that it creates proxies along the way, and not pure stubs. Pure stubs assume that you are mocking everything, but as our goal is to mock as little as possible, using proxies makes more sense.</p>

<p>When using a mockist approach, the message chain is a bad smell because it makes your tests very brittle by depending on a lot of implementation. In contrast, proxy chains are meant to be used where they are the simplest way to inject what you need, without creating havoc.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to display the progress of a very slow background task. You could mock a lot of your objects to have a fast test, of if you wanted to avoid all the bad side effects of mocking, you could run the background task in your test, and have a slow test &hellip; Or, you could use a chain of proxies :</p>

<p>``` ruby
it &lsquo;can override a deep getter&rsquo; do
  allow(RenderingTask).to proxy_message_chain(&ldquo;load.completion_ratio&rdquo;) { |e| e.and_return(0.2523) }</p>

<p>  controller.show</p>

<p>  expect(response).to include(&lsquo;25%&rsquo;)
end
```</p>

<p>Here the simplest thing to do is just to override a small getter, because from a functionnal point of view, that&rsquo;s exactly what we want to test.</p>

<h2>Last word</h2>

<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/philou/rspecproxies">github</a>, v1.0.0 is on <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rspecproxies/versions/0.1.0">rubygems</a>, it requires Ruby v2.2.5 and RSpec v3.5, the license is MIT, help in any form are welcome !</p>

    <updated>2016-01-08T18:18:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-we-started-exploratory-testing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Manual testing is important. Here is how we got to love exploratory testing.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-01-08-how-we-started-exploratory-testing/explore.jpg" title="A map and a telescope for exploration" ></p>

<h2>Initial situation</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.murex.com">At work</a> we are building a risk computation engine for the financial markets. It uses a DSL to describe the exact computations to estimate the risk on the data it knows. This in itself is already complex enough to justify the heavy investment in automated testing we did.</p>

<p>With 90% of automated test coverage, Cucumber scenarios to verify quality, everything should just work &hellip; shouldn&rsquo;t it ?</p>

<h2>First try at exploratory testing</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452279644&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile+development"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-01-08-how-we-started-exploratory-testing/art-of-agile-development.jpg" title="The cover of the Art Of Agile Development" ></a></p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452279644&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile+development">The art of agile development</a>, James Shore details the practice of exploratory testing as a great way of both :</p>

<ul>
<li>improving the quality of the product by finding bugs</li>
<li>improving the process</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s why we gave it a try. Here is the recipe for an exploratory session :</p>

<ol>
<li>Book 1 hour for the full team to do exploratory testing</li>
<li>Prepare a downloadable zip with all the material required to run and test your software</li>
<li>Ask everyone to pick a particular aspect of the system to test during this session</li>
<li>Record bugs when you find one</li>
<li>Spend 30 minutes just after the session to filter duplicate bugs and make sure they are well described</li>
</ol>


<p>Obviously, we also added our special sauce</p>

<ol>
<li>We were to do exploratory testing in pairs, as we do programming, to find more bugs</li>
<li>We gamified it by granting a price to the pair that finds the most bugs. Do you remember how I brought <a href="/how-to-setup-a-weekly-fruit-basket-in-no-time/">fruits for sale in the office</a> ? It turns out we are slowly earning money with the fruits &hellip; enough for the price to be 5 fruits each for the wining pair !</li>
</ol>


<p>This transformed developers into ferocious testers ! I guarantee that with such incentives you&rsquo;ll find bugs &hellip; as we did.</p>

<p><a href="/how-to-setup-a-weekly-fruit-basket-in-no-time/"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-01-08-how-we-started-exploratory-testing/fruits-basket.jpg" title="Our weekly fruit basket at work" ></a></p>

<h2>Doing it systematically</h2>

<p>We took some time to fix all these bugs during a few sprints. And did another exploratory testing session a few months after &hellip;</p>

<p>As we were still finding bugs in the second session, we decided to make them part of the every sprint. As we got better at testing, a lot of bugs started to get uncovered ! So much that we had to change something.</p>

<h2>Improving our process</h2>

<p>We meet in retrospective and here is what we decided :</p>

<ol>
<li>Fix all bugs before working on any other story (obviously, automated tests are added in the process)</li>
<li>Classify what exactly is a bug. For example, for us, a bug is something that used to work or silently returns bad results or corrupts the data</li>
<li>Add exploratory testing by another pair to our definition of done</li>
</ol>


<p>The number of bugs we find during exploratory testing sessions is starting to decrease. We hope that we&rsquo;ll soon be able to do exploratory testing on the fly, as part of our daily work and to completely remove the specific sessions.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>Exploratory testing brought us a lot.</p>

<ul>
<li>Obviously, the product is a lot more solid</li>
<li>We are surely saving time that would have been lost if the bugs had been uncovered by the users</li>
<li>Fixing the bugs forced us to fix some technical debt : bugs often came from areas of the code that we were not so proud or confident of</li>
</ul>


<p>Exploratory testing is a nobrainer. All teams should do it.</p>

<p>So, in the end, as in the old days, we are back to regular manual testing &hellip; but only for exploration.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just discovered a hack to spread agile (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> by the way) through an organization. It works provided :</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a BDD testing expert in your team</li>
<li>Your team is using the work of another software team from your company</li>
</ul>


<p>If this team does not use agile practices, they are likely to regularly create regressions or to be late at providing new versions.</p>

<p>Use your client role in the relation, and propose your help ! Spend some time with them to help them put automated customer tests in place. Be genuinely nice with them, show example, be available and, obviously, bring improvement. With some chance, they might soon be asking for more.</p>
