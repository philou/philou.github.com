    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Excessive use of mocks makes tests very painful to maintain. If we stick painful mocks for too long, we&rsquo;ll end up abandoning unit testing. Eventually, the system will degrade into legacy.Â </p>

<p>There are many techniques to avoid mocks. Some of the most effective involve architecture changes. Unfortunately, there are not the most straightforward to use. Re-architecting involves people and time that you may not dispose of right now. In the following posts, I&rsquo;ll go over techniques that any developer can use in his day to day code to avoid mocks. These battle tested techniques that I&rsquo;ve used on different projects in the past. Check <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the previous post</a> if you&rsquo;re interested to learn how I came to use them.</p>

<p>This is the second post <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">of a series about how to avoid mocks</a> in automated tests. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, I recommend you to read my <a href="/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">first post</a> to understand the perils of mocks in more details.</p>

<p>The first mock fighting small-scale technique I&rsquo;ll go over is <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Immutable Value Objects</a>.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-04-17-how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/immutable-rock.jpg" alt="A drawing of a rock written &quot;Immutable Value Object&quot;" /></p>

<h2>What are Immutable Value Objects ?</h2>

<p>Behind this weird name is something very simple to understand. Immutable Value Objects :</p>

<ul>
<li>Cannot change their state after construction</li>
<li>Only depend on other Immutable Value Objects</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t change the state of the whole system in any way</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t do side effects, like inputs and outputs for example</li>
</ul>


<p>Eric Evans popularized the name in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523985269&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design">Domain-Driven Design Blue Book</a>. Immutable Value Objects have existed for decades in functional languages though. We say these objects are immutable (they cannot change) and pure (they cannot do side effects). Here are 2 interesting properties of Value Objects :</p>

<ul>
<li>you can call a method any number of times with no risk of changing anything to the system</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll always get the same result every time you call the same method on the same object</li>
</ul>


<p>These by itself, can already be handy when testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523985269&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design"><img src="../imgs/2018-04-17-how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/ddd.jpg" alt="Cover of Eric Evans's DDD book" /></a></p>

<h2>How do they prevent mocks ?</h2>

<p>That was a bit theoretical, so let&rsquo;s see how this helps to reduce mocking.</p>

<h3>Simpler &ldquo;init path&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take it the other way round and see how side effects can lead to mocking. Every test starts with setting the state in which to run the test. Side effects make this complicated, as many objects need to collaborate to set this state up. When this becomes too painful, people start hacking around with mocks. This in turn makes the tests more fragile :</p>

<ul>
<li>We are not testing a &ldquo;real&rdquo; situation</li>
<li>We need to keep this setup in line with the real code</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Intricate state initialization encourage people to use mocks.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Isolates parts of the system</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, that is not all the story ! Mutable state also, tricks us into using mocks. As soon as your test deals with mutable state, there is a chance that this state is changed in the &lsquo;real&rsquo; system. This means that some bugs might &lsquo;escape&rsquo; unit tests and appear in end to end tests or in production. That&rsquo;s where the mocks strike ! In order to detect this bug in a fast feedback loop, we&rsquo;re likely to add larger scope tests and use mocks to speed them up &hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Mutable state and side effects make unit tests less effective.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Reduces code with side effects</h3>

<p>But there&rsquo;s another reason why Immutable Value Objects help us to avoid mocks. As we&rsquo;ll try to use them more and more for the previous two reasons, we&rsquo;ll need to adapt our programming style. As we&rsquo;ll push more and more code in Immutable Value Objects, the &lsquo;imperative&rsquo; part will shrink. This &lsquo;imperative&rsquo; part is where side-effect happen. This is the part where mocking out IOs makes sense. To summarize, the more Immutable Value Objects we use, the more isolated the IOs are, and the less mocking we need.</p>

<p>Javascript expert Eric Elliot also wrote about the immutability and mocks <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Next week</h2>

<p>This was the second post in a <a href="/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">series about how to prevent mocks</a> in your automated tests. Next post will be an example of using immutable value objects on the <a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/">FizzBuzz kata</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Mock hell : when excessive use of test mocks makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a> extremely slow or difficult.</p></blockquote>

<p>A few years ago, I managed to get a side project out of mock hell. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been using what I learned to avoid mocks in all the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on. This is the start of a series of posts about my mock-avoiding techniques.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2018-04-10-careless-mocking-considered-harmful/mocks-dont-rock.jpg" alt="A tag &quot;Mocks don't rock !&quot;" /></p>

<h2>Escape from Mock Hell</h2>

<p>Between 2010 and 2014, I was working on a side project I called <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses">http://mes-courses.fr</a>. Which actually means &ldquo;my house shopping&rdquo; in English. I wanted people to be able to do their house shopping in 5 minutes, by using a better UI for online groceries. I was using Ruby, and I had just read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523422024&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests</a>. I got a bit too excited with mocking, and was using it way too much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d been practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> for more than 5 years and I was expecting great results with a language like Ruby. After a few months though, I could feel that something was not going as well as it should. The test initialization code was getting longer and longer, as it included a lot of mock setup. This made the tests more complex and less readable. It also made them unreliable, as it was not rare for all my unit tests to pass while the system was not working. I was taking the habit of running my end to end test more and more often. I was also losing a lot of time maintaining the mock setup code in line with the real classes. Mocks also tricked me into the bad practice of keeping a 1 to 1 mapping between code and test files. That again increased my maintenance burden when moving code from one file to another.</p>

<p>It reached a point where I could not take it anymore. All these problems were pointing at mocks, so I tried to remove them from a test file. Here are the techniques I ended up using to remove them mocks :Â </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Objects</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builders</a></li>
<li><a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/custom-matchers">Test Matchers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Hexagonal architecture</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">In-memory fakes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wincent.com/wiki/Proxy_(test_double">Proxy doubles</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>The end result was beyond my hopes, as my problems almost magically disappeared. The code got simpler, I became a lot more confident about my unit tests, and they got easier to maintain. As an illustration, here is an excerpts from the diff of a rails controller test file which went through this mock diet.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/commit/2c9fce17f9b59d0b3828f309015c07b17cceddf4?diff=split"><img src="../imgs/2018-04-10-careless-mocking-considered-harmful/diff.jpg" alt="A screen capture of a Github diff showing a test file going on a mock diet" /></a></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the long term risk ?</h2>

<p>Basically, excessive mocking arms the maintainability of the tests. Here is what would have happened if I&rsquo;d done nothing. Tests would have become so painful to maintain that I would have started to ignore or delete them. As coverage would decrease, more and more code would become untested. That&rsquo;s exactly Michael Feathers' definition of Legacy Code :</p>

<blockquote><p>Legacy Code is code without tests. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523422039&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=legacy+code">Michael Feathers</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To summarize, excessive use of mocks leads to legacy code ! As most of us have learned the hard way, the further a system drifts into legacy, the lower the productivity.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Excessive use of mocks leads to legacy code</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More than ever, the cheapest way to build a framework is to refactor it out of a specific app.</p>

<p><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> is a web development server side framework built in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>. It&rsquo;s been and remains very popular. It set the tone for all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a> web frameworks that followed. People have ported it to many other languages. Rails is now in it&rsquo;s 5th version, what is less known is how it was built in the first place.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-09-what-rails-teaches-us-about-building-platforms-and-frameworks/train-and-rails.jpg" alt="Drawing of a train being detached from its rails" /></p>

<h2>The story of Rails</h2>

<p><a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>, the creator of Rails, is a cult in the Ruby community. You can find the history of Rails at many places. If you have a bit of time, read <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/02/mf-signals/?currentPage=all">this great article</a> from Wired. If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of time, here is a summary.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried?lang=fr">Jason Fried</a> and DHH were working at <a href="https://37signals.com/">37signals</a>. They were working on project management app for small businesses called <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. After releasing the first version of Basecamp, DHH extracted and open sourced Rails out of it.</p>

<p>37signals later then re-used Rails to build other apps like Campfire, Highrise and Backpack.</p>

<p>We all know the end of the story, Rails adoption exploded. Many successful companies like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> have used it. It evolved a lot, through the darwinism of open source. Today, Rails might not be the latest and coolest web framework, but it is still very productive and popular.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-10-09-what-rails-teaches-us-about-building-platforms-and-frameworks/rails-logo.jpg" alt="The Rails logo" /></p>

<h2>Economic sense</h2>

<p>To summarize, here is how they did it :</p>

<ol>
<li>Built a specific app, and monetized it</li>
<li>Extracted an open source framework from it</li>
<li>Built other apps on the framework</li>
</ol>


<p>If you are not a programmers, you&rsquo;re likely to assume that the cost of reusing software is negligible. If you are a programmer, I&rsquo;ll ask you to assume that it is for a while. Â Under this hypothesis, all they did makes a lot of business sense :</p>

<ul>
<li>Building a specific app first is the fastest path to paying customers. Building a framework first would need more work.</li>
<li>Once you have paying customers, you&rsquo;ve got money to fuel further work.</li>
<li>In particular, you have money to finance the extraction of an open source framework.</li>
<li>Putting the framework open source increases its reusability through bug reports and contributions.</li>
<li>Building the next app is even easier thanks to a mature framework and the revenues from the original app</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Once you have paying customers, you&rsquo;ve got money to fuel further work.</p></blockquote>

<h2>How can it work ?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507610064&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rework"><img src="../imgs/2017-10-09-what-rails-teaches-us-about-building-platforms-and-frameworks/rework-cover.jpg" alt="Cover of Rework book" /></a></p>

<p>Ok, enough for common sense. Let&rsquo;s see what happens when you take into account the real cost of changing software ? All software developers know that changing software is far from cheap. Very often, it&rsquo;s more expensive to adapt than to rebuild</p>

<p>So how did the Rails guys manage it ? Rails has 3 specificities that explain that :</p>

<ul>
<li>Rails has automated testing built in and out</li>
<li>Basecamp guys are agile with a lower &lsquo;a&rsquo;. They don&rsquo;t follow Scrum or any method. Read <a href="https://basecamp.com/about/books">their books</a> and you&rsquo;ll understand how agile they are. They follow principles like KISS, YAGNI, Lean startup discovery &hellip;</li>
<li>Finally, it was open sourced !</li>
</ul>


<p>Agile principles and technical practices is what allowed them to take the common-sense path.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Thanks to agile practices, the cheapest way to build a framework is to extract it from a specific app.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Open question</h2>

<p>If it is possible to do the thing that makes the most economic sense, why isn&rsquo;t it the default way ? Why are so many of us still losing a ton of money writing large frameworks and platforms up-front ? How could we get large companies to adopt the more nimble &lsquo;basecamp&rsquo; way ?</p>

    <updated>2017-09-29T06:15:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/lessons-learned-from-running-our-first-improvement-kata</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the past few weeks, I blogged the <a href="/how-we-used-the-improvement-kata-to-gain-25-percent-of-productivity-part-1/">story of our first improvement kata</a>.</p>

<p>Doing this first <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/The_Improvement_Kata.html">improvement kata</a> taught us many lessons. We re-discovered best practices of the software industry. We also learned more general things about the improvement kata itself.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-09-29-lessons-learned-from-running-our-first-improvement-kata/lessons.jpg" alt="Drawing of books" /></p>

<h2>Rediscovered best practices</h2>

<p>As we went through the kata, we &lsquo;proved&rsquo; many known best practices. We did not have to <em>believe</em> them, we had data explaining that they worked. For example :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates">#NoEstimate</a> works. Back in <a href="/how-we-used-the-improvement-kata-to-gain-25-percent-of-productivity-part-3/">part 3</a> we saw that the story point and story count curves were very similar, almost identical</li>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/0-bugs-policy">#NoBug policy</a> was part of the solution to our problem</li>
<li>Doing more exploratory testing resulted in less bug fixing and increased our productivity. This proves principles like &ldquo;<a href="http://deming14points.com/quotes/build-quality-in/">Build quality in"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Tom_DeMarco">&ldquo;Quality is free&rdquo;</a></li>
</ul>


<p>We also pushed the #NoBug policy further than it is usually done. We defined a clear definition for bugs that anyone could use. Doing so, we removed the product owner (or on-site customer) from the picture. Very often, the PO is the only one who can sort stories from bugs out. We created what <a href="http://reinertsenassociates.com/category/tips/">Donald Reinertsen</a> calls a distributed rule in the <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009">flow book</a>. It increased empowerment, removes bottlenecks, while ensuring alignment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009"><img src="../imgs/2017-09-29-lessons-learned-from-running-our-first-improvement-kata/flow-book-cover.jpg" alt="The 'Flow' book cover" /></a></p>

<h2>The improvement kata</h2>

<p>The first general lesson that we learned is that the improvement kata works !</p>

<p>At the beginning, we were very uneasy not to have perfect data. Remember how we had to resort to velocity as a proxy measure for productivity. In the end, that was not a severe problem. It still allowed us to understand what was going on.</p>

<p>We also learned that <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/retrospectives/">retrospective</a> is not the only road to continuous improvement. In fact, the improvement kata and retrospectives are very different :</p>

<ul>
<li>The time frame is different. A retrospective lasts for 1 or 2 hours and yield immediate results. An improvement kata is a background task that could take months in theory !</li>
<li>But the improvement kata also digs a lot deeper in the topic and brings true understanding. In our case, it fixed a problem that retrospectives where failing to address.</li>
<li>Ownership is also different. Retrospectives are a team activity. The improvement kata needs one or a few owners. It would be very difficult to align everyone on the same path of thoughts if we did it as a group activity.</li>
<li>Being a team activity, retrospectives have built-in alignment. The conclusions of the improvement kata must explained and agreed for a team to act on them. A good practice is to have regular (short) team meetings to share the current state of an improvement kata.</li>
<li>As the improvement kata is a more individual activity, it is more remote friendly. Team members can run the kata on their side, sharing everything through a wiki, or a blog for example.</li>
</ul>


<p>Keep in mind that this was our first try at the kata. Some of our difficulties might disappear with a bit of practice !</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next ?</h2>

<h3>Hybrid continuous improvement</h3>

<p>I clarified the differences between the improvement kata and retrospectives. That&rsquo;s not the end of it. I&rsquo;m sure a mixed format could be very interesting ! Start with a retrospective to collect the team&rsquo;s problems, and vote on the more important. Add a corresponding improvement kata task to the backlog. Someone would then handle this improvement task, sharing with the team along the way.</p>

<p>This might be a great opportunity to reduce meeting time with shorter retrospectives.</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Reduce meeting time with mixed retrospective &amp; improvement kata</p></blockquote>

<h3>Data science for software</h3>

<p>Going through this improvement kata made me realize something else. It is very difficult to get quality data to investigate. We had to resort to what was available all the way.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s striking is that we use software tool for all our work ! These tools have logs and could record usage data somewhere. Imagine all we could learn by mining all this data ! Our IDEs, CI servers, quality monitors, test tools, version control and project management tools should store everything we do at the same place !</p>

<p>With all this data, could we improve our estimations ? Could we find creative ways to be more productive ? Could we estimate the speed up that fixing some technical debt would bring ?</p>

<blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ What are we waiting to apply data science to the development process ?</p></blockquote>

<p>As the saying goes, &ldquo;The cobbler&rsquo;s children go barefoot&rdquo;. We are building such systems for others, but not for ourselves.</p>

<p>Hopefully, new tools like <a href="https://codescene.io/">CodeScene</a> are emerging to fill this gap. You can learn more about CodeScene on their <a href="https://codescene.io/">website</a>, or from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Code-Crime-Scene-Bottlenecks/dp/1680500384">founder&rsquo;s book</a>. It analyses the version control history to find hot spots and other things in your code.</p>

<p>While we keep dreaming of such tool, I&rsquo;ll continue to blog. Next week, I will write a short guide of <a href="/how-to-run-your-first-improvement-kata/">how to run your first improvement kata</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the fifth (and last) post of a <a href="/blog/categories/first-improvement-kata-series/">series of 5</a> about the improvement kata. If you haven&rsquo;t read the beginning of the story, I recommend you start from <a href="/how-we-used-the-improvement-kata-to-gain-25-percent-of-productivity-part-1/">part 1</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/how-we-used-the-improvement-kata-to-gain-25-percent-of-productivity-part-4/">previous post</a>, we decided to adjust our definition of a bug to limit the time lost on nice-to-have bug fixes.</p>

<p>It would take a while to know if adjusting the definition of a bug would help us or not. At the same time, we knew it would not help us to reduce the number of bugs we escaped to other teams.</p>

<h2>Idea 3 : More exploratory testing</h2>

<p>We decided to push on this matter as well. This means that we would be running two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA">PDCAs (Plan-Do-Check-Act)</a> at the same time. This is not the improvement kata procedure by the book. That could have been an error from our side, as first time users of the kata. Or maybe it&rsquo;s a pragmatic habit to adapt the kata to real life &hellip; I guess we&rsquo;ll know better as we apply the kata more often. The danger is that the different experiments can conflict with each other. When measuring the results, it becomes difficult to link observations with experiments. Anyway, back to our own situation, as you&rsquo;ll see, it ended up well for us.</p>

<p>The first thing was to know a bit more about our bugs. Checking the recently closed bugs yielded suspicions about a recent features. Analyzing further proved our gut feeling.</p>

<p>Ignoring the Christmas drop at the middle of the curve, we concluded 2 things from these graphs :</p>

<ul>
<li>We were leaking bugs to the product</li>
<li>Bugs mostly came from newly added features</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Despite all our automated tests and regular Â exploratory testing, we were leaking bugs.</p></blockquote>

<p>We decided to do more exploratory testing for a while ! We were already doing exploratory testing at the end of every story. We added an extra 1 hour team session of exploratory testing every sprint.</p>

<h2>Do, Check &amp; Act</h2>

<p>We used these new conventions for a few weeks. We did more exploratory testing, and would be more strict about what a bug was. We stuck to our prioritization : first improvements, then bugs and only after, stories.</p>

<p>After a few weeks of that, we were able to update our bug trend and do a linear regression on it again. Here were the results :</p>

<p>Hurray ! As you can see, we were to be done with bugs around April 2017, which was 3 months away at that time.</p>

<p>We confidently adopted these practices as part of our working agreements. This brought our first improvement kata to its end.</p>

<h2>3 months later</h2>

<p>As you know, April 2017 is long gone. I can now give you a more up to date report of the actual effects on the team&rsquo;s daily work.Â </p>

<p>First, the backlog does not contain bugs anymore. We payed the bug debt back. Second, we still discover some bugs from time to time, but a lot less than we used to. To summarize, there is now a pair of developers (25%) of the team that can work on user stories instead of fixing bugs.</p>

<p>As we are still fixing bugs as they appear, the 25% productivity gain claim might be an overstatement, but 20% is not. At the same time, less bugs are now escaping. This means that the whole organization is saving on interruptions and rework. 25% might not be such a bold claim after all !</p>

<h2>This is it !</h2>

<p>This was post 5 in a <a href="/blog/categories/first-improvement-kata-series/">series of 5</a> about the improvement kata. I&rsquo;m not completely done writing about this improvement kata though. In the coming weeks, I&rsquo;ll post about the <a href="/lessons-learned-from-running-our-first-improvement-kata/">lessons learned</a> and <a href="/how-to-run-your-first-improvement-kata/">how to start your own improvement kata</a>.</p>
