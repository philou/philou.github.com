    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/"/>
    <updated>2017-05-15T06:53:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> a long time ago. Since then, even though I&rsquo;m still not a master, it&rsquo;s been my most useful programming skill, by far. TDD is the first trick every new programmer should learn. It made my whole career as a developer easier.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a professional software engineer for more than 15 years, including around 10 years in the trading industry. Only once did I need to work on week ends or late into the night to fix emergency issues. I believe I largely owe this work-life balance to the high test coverage that TDD ensures by design.</p>

<p>TDD also enables safe refactoring. Refactoring enables <a href="/incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/">incremental design</a> which lets you decide late. Deciding late is how you make your customers happy by accepting late changes. Deciding late is how take up-front design easy, and improve your code as you go. Deciding late is how you build trustful and harmonious relationships with the stakeholders of your project.</p>

<p>Finally, writing tests before the code is both easier and more fun. Among compilation errors and never ending customer demands, the recurring green barre tastes like pure candy to the poor programmer !</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/road.jpg" alt="A long winding road" /><div class="image-credits">From <a href="https://fr.pinterest.com/explore/winding-road/">Pinterest winding road catalog</a></div></p>

<h2>The TDD Road</h2>

<p>Here are the steps I took to learn TDD.</p>

<h3>Learn the principles</h3>

<p>The principles of Test Driven Development are fairly basic. 5 minutes is enough to know them forever :</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a failing test</li>
<li>Make it pass by doing the simplest thing possible</li>
<li>Refactor your code while keeping the tests passing</li>
<li>Repeat until your acceptance test is green</li>
</ol>


<p>TDD newbies might ask a few questions like :</p>

<ul>
<li>Is making the code compile in step 1 or 2 ? Honestly, that does not matter. Write the test as if you had the code, then make it compile, make sure it fails, and continue.</li>
<li>How much should I refactor ? It often takes a good amount of experimentation to find your good balance. If you don&rsquo;t refactor enough, you going to drown in dirty code. If you refactor too much, you&rsquo;re going to waste your time (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html">YAGNI</a>). As a rule of thumb, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html">Kent Beck&rsquo;s</a> rules on simple design are a very good starting point :</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/beck-rules.jpg" alt="A visual graph of Kent Beck's rules of simple design" /></a><div class="image-credits"><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html">From Martin Fowler : Beck Design Rules</a></div></p>

<h3>Find your tools</h3>

<p>Back in 2003, after reading <a href="TODO">Martin Fowler</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080119&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=martin+fowler+refactoring">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a> book, I decided to give TDD a serious try. I was using C++ at work but we did not even have a nightly build. I had to download and setup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CppUnit">CppUnit</a> on my own. As solo endeavor, this was a required step to get into TDD.</p>

<p>Find and setup a tool. Which one should be rather obvious, if your team already uses a unit test framework, stick to it, otherwise, pick the most standard for your language, ex : <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> for <a href="https://www.java.com">Java</a> (you might as well start searching for a new job where they use a unit testing tool).</p>

<h3>Train at a TDD coding dojo</h3>

<p><a href="http://codingdojo.org/">Coding dojos</a> were first invented as a tool to <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/">learn TDD</a>. They were started by two french eXtreme Programmers <a href="https://ut7.fr/">Emmanuel Gaillot</a> and <a href="http://institut-agile.fr/">Laurent Bossavit</a>. It happens that I live in Paris, and that Emmanuel came to work as a contractor at the same company I was. I learned that he was organizing a weekly coding dojo open to any developer. That&rsquo;s how I started attending coding dojos. Looking back, the TDD skills I learned at the coding dojo are just enormous !</p>

<p>If you are serious about learning TDD, attend coding dojos. Whether you find one in your city (ask <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a>) or in your company does not really matter. If you cannot find any, just start one at work ! Send a public call for interested people (use wiki, mail, posters or whatever), book a room and start hacking ! <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Dojo-Handbook-Emily-Bache/dp/919811803X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494908749&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coding+dojo">Emily Bache&rsquo;s Coding Dojo Handbook</a> seems a very good reference about how to start a coding dojo (Disclaimer : I did not read the book, I only know it by reputation.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Dojo-Handbook-Emily-Bache/dp/919811803X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494908749&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coding+dojo"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/coding-dojo.jpg" alt="Cover of The Coding Dojo Handbook" /></a></p>

<h3>Use it</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a professional programmer, you must be spending most of your time writing code. Take this opportunity to use TDD. You&rsquo;ll be slowed down a bit at the beginning, but as both your code and your skills improve, you&rsquo;ll get your time back manyfold.</p>

<p>I remember one of my first professional use of TDD was to write a small parser. A few weeks later I was asked to make it faster. Having tests around it made it easy to optimize it without breaking it.</p>

<h3>Deliberate practice</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-20-Hours-Learn-Anything/dp/1591846943/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494910468&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+first+20+hours">The first 20 hours</a>, Josh Kaufman explains that deliberately practicing specific topics is a more time effective way of learning than simply crunching hours of practice.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/tpierrain">Thomas Pierrain</a> is used to regularly practice short 30 minutes katas to sharpen his programming skills. Katas can be found at <a href="http://codingdojo.org/KataCatalogue/">codingdojo.org</a>, at <a href="http://cyber-dojo.org/">cyber-dojo.org</a> or in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Dojo-Handbook-Emily-Bache/dp/919811803X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494908749&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coding+dojo">The Coding Dojo Handbook</a>.</p>

<h3>Read</h3>

<p>Meanwhile I was doing all this, I also spent a lot of time reading on the subject. At the time, there was a lot of things about TDD in the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/">C2 Wiki</a>, so I spent a lot of time there. Since then, I stumbled upon a few books that helped me to understand some aspects of TDD :</p>

<ul>
<li>Kent Beck&rsquo;s classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080564&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tdd+by+example">TDD by example</a> remains a great reference for beginners</li>
<li>I got very useful advices from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Practical-Guide/dp/0131016490/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494911486&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=test+driven+practical+guide">TDD, a practical guide</a> especially the section about UI testing, which really saved me at some point</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080583&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests</a> is now a classic about what is called &ldquo;The London school of testing&rdquo;, which uses mocks as a design tool. Definitely a must read.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080583&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/growing.jpg" alt="Cover of GOOSGT" /></a></p>

<h3>Practice advanced topics</h3>

<p>The TDD road goes on forever, testing has a lot of tricky topics. Once you&rsquo;ve mastered the basics, it&rsquo;s quite interesting to explore and practice more complex subjects. Here are a few things worth trying out :</p>

<ul>
<li>Use automated IDE refactorings to keep the code compiling all the way through a kata</li>
<li>Do the same kata twice, using <a href="/flavours-of-tdd/">top-down and bottom-up</a> styles</li>
<li>Do refactoring katas to learn how to work with legacy code</li>
<li>Do UI katas, to learn how to test the UI</li>
<li>Learn how to deal with DB</li>
<li>Learn how to handle remote services</li>
</ul>


<p>If needed, invent your own katas to deliberately practice these topics and others.</p>

<h2>The pitfalls</h2>

<p>As any road worth walking, the TDD path is not linear and smooth. Before fully mastering TDD, you&rsquo;ll regularly wonder if you&rsquo;re on the right track. As any practice, TDD has pitfalls. I&rsquo;ve fell into some quite a few times. I guess that&rsquo;s part of the learning process.</p>

<h3>Emerging Design</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s always been a lot of misunderstanding around this topic.</p>

<p>Bad smells in your code make your tests harder to write. If adding a test is painful, that&rsquo;s an indication that something could be improved in your design. It&rsquo;s then up to you to know what. Once you&rsquo;ve figured out what you want to change, use your existing tests to refactor your design first. Only then, add this new test.</p>

<p>As you can see, the tests will give you more feedback about the design of your code, but they won&rsquo;t tell you what to do. That&rsquo;s where your coding skills will help. This is particularly true about algorithms. Don&rsquo;t expect a good algorithm to magically appear as you do the simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work &hellip;</p>

<p>As with any rules, there are exceptions. At times, you&rsquo;ll walk into a problem which emerging design is great. For example, I&rsquo;ve done the <a href="http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/RomanNumerals-Kata">Arab to Romans</a> kata many times, and that repeatedly doing the simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work yields a good solution.</p>

<h3>Mocks</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">Mocks</a> are useful at times, but be careful not to overuse them. I already <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/mocking/">wrote about mocks</a>. Too much mocking makes your test suite brittle, ineffective and difficult to maintain ! I&rsquo;ve been bitten hard by this one on a personal <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses">side project</a>, the day I decided to get rid of all the mocks, I shrank the test code size by 25%. Since then I learned about alternate techniques such as :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test data builders</a> which allow to easily build test data</li>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value objects</a> that are immutable and don&rsquo;t need mocking</li>
<li><a href="/my-new-gem-for-creating-rspec-proxies/">test spies and proxies</a> as a way to mock and track calls while still calling the real code</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:4000/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">in-memory fake implementations</a> which make the tests independent and fast without unmaintainable proliferation of mock setup</li>
</ul>


<p>As an indicator, less than 5% of my tests use mocks.</p>

<h3>Metrics</h3>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M">keynote at RailsConf 2014</a> DHH explains the danger of testing metrics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/dhh.jpg" alt="DHH's keynote at RailsConf 2014" /></a></p>

<p>By using TDD correctly, you should get a high code coverage as a side effect. If you get below 80%, you must be doing something wrong. The other metric you should keep an eye on is the total build time. Original <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> had the <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/ten_minute_build.html">10 minutes build rule</a> which states that if your build + tests takes more than 10 minutes, you should refactor it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it ! Things like 100% test coverage or test ratio are complete nonsense.</p>

<h2>Pushing it even further</h2>

<p>My promise, at the beginning of this post, was that Test Driven Development would make your life as a developer easier. Now let&rsquo;s imagine that your whole team or company was using TDD. It&rsquo;s a foundation on which to build a sustainable agile organization.</p>

<p>The mastery of automated testing at organization scale is a key element to continuous delivery, making releasing software a non-event, and as stress-free as possible.</p>

<p>Full adoption of TDD can yield to <a href="/incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/">incremental architecture</a> which delivers features faster, by skipping the conflictual arguments about supposed future needs.</p>

<p>Finally, TDD can simplify your processes and tooling. Team-wide TDD results in a steady flow of features on top of which it is easier to create simple and effective processes and tools.</p>

<p>The road is long, sinuous and at times rocky, but so are the rewards.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-mock-your-browsers-timezone-with-jasmine-and-momentjs/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-30T06:29:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-mock-your-browsers-timezone-with-jasmine-and-momentjs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I&rsquo;ve been working at adding a distributed countdown to my <a href="https://github.com/philou/planning-poker">Online Planning Poker App</a>. As our team works from Paris and Beirut, I wanted to unit test that it would work well through different timezones. I found a surprisingly simple solution.</p>

<h2>What Google told me</h2>

<p>I first searched Google to see how to do it. I found 2 answers that looked promising :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://balanceiskey.github.io/2016/01/27/mocking-timezones.html">You can use moment-timezone to mock timezones in Jasmine</a> which I unfortunately did not manage to use</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12220717/how-to-mock-the-browsers-timezone">How to mock the browser&rsquo;s timezone?</a> which seemed a bit of hack</li>
</ul>


<p>Known results for such a simple situation were disappointing !</p>

<h2>What I ended up with</h2>

<p>After a good deal of dabbling around, I eventually found a pretty simple solution using <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> and <a href="https://momentjs.com/timezone/">Moment Timezone</a> :</p>

<p><code>javascript
jasmine.clock().install();
...
jasmine.clock().mockDate(moment.tz("2017-03-23 10:00:00", "Europe/Paris").toDate())
</code></p>

<p>Obviously, the drawback is that it implies setting both the timezone <em>and the time</em>. This should be ok in most of unit tests though, but might be an issue in some cases.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-minutes-hack-to-speed-up-rspec-in-rails-5-using-in-memory-sqlite/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-25T07:53:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-minutes-hack-to-speed-up-rspec-in-rails-5-using-in-memory-sqlite</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is the story : you have a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails 5</a> app that uses <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>, but your RSpec suite is getting slower and slower to run. You&rsquo;ve already considered some solutions :</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> in memory for your test env.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>yaml
test:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: ":memory:"
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the most straightforward thing to do, but unfortunately, if you are sharing your test env with <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a>, you might want to use a production like DB with Cucumber (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> or whatever). So unless you are ready to setup a new env for cucumber (which I tried and don&rsquo;t recommend) you&rsquo;re stuck.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use mocks. That&rsquo;s surely going to work, it&rsquo;s going to make your test hell of a lot faster ! It will also make your tests a lot more fragile and more expensive to maintain &hellip; If you want to read more about why I think mocks are a bad idea, just have a look at <a href="/blog/categories/mocking/">these posts</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The hack</h2>

<p>Here is a third alternative, I&rsquo;ve <a href="/simplest-way-to-speed-up-rspec-with-in-memory-sqlite-db/">already written about it</a>, but here it comes updated and tested for Rails 5 :</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t change anything to your <code>config/database.yml</code></li>
<li>Obviously, you&rsquo;ll need to add <code>sqlite3</code> to your <code>Gemfile</code></li>
<li>At the beginning of your <code>spec/rails_helper.rb</code>, replace</li>
</ol>


<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>Checks for pending migration and applies them before tests are run.</h1>

<h1>If you are not using ActiveRecord, you can remove this line.</h1>

<p>ActiveRecord::Migration.maintain_test_schema!
```</p>

<p>with</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>In order to keep the same RAILS_ENV for rspec and cucumber, and to make rspec</h1>

<h1>faster, patch the connection to use sqlite in memory when running rspec</h1>

<p>ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: &lsquo;sqlite3&rsquo;, database: &lsquo;:memory:&rsquo;)
ActiveRecord::Schema.verbose = false
load &ldquo;#{Rails.root.to_s}/db/schema.rb&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it ! Run your specs &hellip; not bad for a 5 minutes investment !</p>

<h4>Rails 5.1 (2017-03-29 Edit)</h4>

<p>My fresh hack started to fail on Rails 5.1 ! If <code>schema.rb</code> is generated with the Postgres adapter, it is now incompatible with this injected Sqlite adapter. Here is a patch that removes the glitches :</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>In order to keep the same RAILS_ENV for rspec and cucumber, and to make rspec</h1>

<h1>faster, patch the connection to use sqlite in memory when running rspec</h1>

<p>ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: &lsquo;sqlite3&rsquo;, database: &lsquo;:memory:&rsquo;)
ActiveRecord::Schema.verbose = false</p>

<h1>load db agnostic schema by default. Needed to remove the &ldquo;, id: :serial&rdquo; from</h1>

<h1>the table definitions to make it load on sqlite</h1>

<p>eval(<code>cat #{Rails.root.to_s}/db/schema.rb | sed 's/,[^:]*: :serial\//g'</code>)
```</p>

<p>I admit this is getting a bit crappy, and I don&rsquo;t know how long it is going to work &hellip;</p>

<h2>One more thing &hellip;</h2>

<p>If you need even more speed, you can now run your specs in parallel in different processes ! Each in-memory SQLite DB is bound to its process, so unlike a real PostgreSQL dev DB, you won&rsquo;t get any conflicts between your tests ;&ndash;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the years doing some coding dojos with the same circle of people, I came up with my own style of practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>. Lately, I had the chance to do a pair programming session with someone I did not know. That made me realize that they are in fact even more ways to practice TDD than I thought.</p>

<h2>Mockist vs Classisist</h2>

<p>A lot has already been written (and discussed) about these two approaches. I myself have already <a href="/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">blogged</a> about the subject, I even gave a <a href="/how-not-to-use-mocks-my-talk-at-paris-rb/">talk</a> about it. From my own point of view, I believe that the inconvenients of making mocking the default far outweights the benefits. I&rsquo;m not saying that mocks aren&rsquo;t useful from time to time, but rather that they should remain the exception.</p>

<h2>Top-Down vs Bottom-Up</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s the reason why I wrote this post. This is the main difference I found between my style and my pair&rsquo;s. Let me explain.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-20-flavours-of-tdd/topdown-vs-bottomup.jpg" title="Top-Down vs Bottom-Up" ></p>

<h3>Top-Down</h3>

<p>Doing TDD top-down means starting with high level end to end tests, implementing the minimum to make it work, refactor and repeat. A bit like BDD, the point is to focus on the expected behavior, and avoid writing useless things. The bad point is that the refactoring part can get pretty difficult. On real life code, strictly following top-down would mean writing a feature test first, passing it with a quick and dirty implementation, to then spend hours trying to refactor all that mess &hellip; good luck !</p>

<p>Here is another example, from coding dojos this time. Having had success with the top-down approach during previous dojos, we once intentionally tried to code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#">Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life</a> using a top-down approach. We did so by writing high level tests that were checking special patterns (gliders &hellip;). That was a nightmare ! It felt like trying to reverse engineer the rules of the game from real use cases. It did not bring us anywhere.</p>

<h3>Bottom-Up</h3>

<p>At the other side of the spectrum, you can do bottom-up TDD. This means unit testing and implementing all the small bricks you think you&rsquo;ll need to provide the expected overall feature. The idea is to avoid tunnels and to get fast feedback on what you are coding. The bad side is that you might be coding something that will end up being unnecessary. Be careful, if you find yourself spending a lot of time building up utility classes, you might be doing too much bottom-up implementation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals">Numerals to Romans Kata</a> is a good exercise to fail at bottom-up. Every time I did this exercise during a coding dojo, people new to it would start to come up with complicated ways to do it (often involving complex array manipulation). Compared to that, applying disciplined bottom-up TDD brings a <a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Algorithm-Roman-Numeral-Converter">brutally effective solution for Numerals to Romans</a>.</p>

<h2>Mixed approach</h2>

<p>Both approaches have their pros and cons. I really believe developers who are serious about TDD should master both, and learn when to apply each. In fact, as often, the best approach lies somewhere in the middle. Here&rsquo;s my recipe :</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a high level feature test</li>
<li>try to make it pass &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; (usually) fail</li>
<li>rollback or shelve your test and draft implementation</li>
<li>build a brick</li>
<li>unshelve</li>
<li>try to make it pass &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; and so one until the high level test finally passes.</li>
</ol>


<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s a lot like the <a href="https://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/">Mikado Method</a> for building features instead of refactoring.</p>

<h2>Practice in dojos</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to intentionally practice this in coding dojos as well. Most kata should be OK, as long as the group agrees to fix it using this particular approach up front.</p>

<p>If during the dojo, you&rsquo;ve just written a test, suddenly realize that it won&rsquo;t be easy to get it passing, and that you&rsquo;ve got the elements spread out in your code, this is the time ! Comment the test, get the green bar, refactor, uncomment the test, try to make it pass, repeat &hellip; Eventually, you&rsquo;ll have all the bricks to make it easy to pass your test.</p>

<p>Some might say this is not &lsquo;pure&rsquo; TDD, but that sounds like cargo cult to me ! As long as you make sure you are not building useless stuff, and that you keep the feedback loop as short as possible, you&rsquo;re on the right track.</p>
