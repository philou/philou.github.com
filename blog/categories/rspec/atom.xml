<p>Pure mocks are dangerous. They let defect go through, give a false sense of security and are difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already talked about it <a href="/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">before</a> but since then, <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">DHH announced that he was quitting TDD</a>, the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/">Is TDD Dead ?</a> debate took place, and the conclusion is that <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/mockists-are-dead-long-live-classicists">mockist are dead</a>.</p>

<p>They are still times when mocks feel much simpler than any other things. For example, imagine your process leaks and crashes after 10 hours, the fix is to pass an option to a thirdparty, how would you test this in a fast test ? That&rsquo;s exactly the kind of situation where using test proxies saves you from mocks. A test proxy defers everything to the real object but also features unintrusive hooks and probes that you can use in your test. If you want a code example, check <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/commit/2c9fce17f9b59d0b3828f309015c07b17cceddf4?diff=split">this commit</a>, where I refactored a rails controller test from mocks to a RSpecProxies (v0.1).</p>

<p>I created RSpecProxies <a href="/my-new-gem-for-creating-rspec-proxies/">a while ago</a>, a while ago, and it&rsquo;s syntax made it alien to the RSpec work, it needed an update. <a href="http://rspec.info">RSpec</a> now supports basic proxying with partial stubs, spies, the <code>and_call_original</code> and the <code>and_wrap_original</code> methods. <a href="https://github.com/philou/rspecproxies">RSpecProxies 1.0</a> is a collection of hooks built on top of these to make proxying easier, with a syntax that will be familiar to RSpec users.</p>

<h2>Before original hook</h2>

<p>This hook is triggered before a call a method. Suppose you want to simulate a bad connection :</p>

<p>```ruby
it &lsquo;can simulate unreliable connection&rsquo; do
  i = 0
  allow(Resource).to receive(:get).and_before_calling_original { |*args|</p>

<pre><code>i += 1
raise RuntimeError.new if i % 3 == 0
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  resources = Resource.get_at_least(10)</p>

<p>  expect(resources.size).to eq(10)
end
```</p>

<h2>After original hooks</h2>

<p>RSpecProxies provides the same kind of hook after the call :</p>

<p>``` ruby
it &lsquo;can check that the correct data is used (using and_after_calling_original&rsquo; do
  user = nil
  allow(User).to receive(:load).and_after_calling_original { |result| user = result }</p>

<p>  controller.login(&lsquo;joe&rsquo;, &lsquo;secret&rsquo;)</p>

<p>  expect(response).to include(user.created_at.to_s)
end
```</p>

<p>Here we are capturing the return value to use it later in the test. For this special purpose, RSpecProxies also provides 2 other helpers :</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>Store the latest result in @user of self</h1>

<p>allow(User).to receive(:load).and_capture_result_into(self, :user)</p>

<h1>Collect all results in the users array</h1>

<p>users = []
allow(User).to receive(:load).and_collect_results_into(users)
```</p>

<h2>Proxy chains</h2>

<p>RSpec mocks provides the <code>message_chain</code> feature to do build chains of stubs. RSpecProxy provides a very similar proxy chain concept. The main difference is that it creates proxies along the way, and not pure stubs. Pure stubs assume that you are mocking everything, but as our goal is to mock as little as possible, using proxies makes more sense.</p>

<p>When using a mockist approach, the message chain is a bad smell because it makes your tests very brittle by depending on a lot of implementation. In contrast, proxy chains are meant to be used where they are the simplest way to inject what you need, without creating havoc.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to display the progress of a very slow background task. You could mock a lot of your objects to have a fast test, of if you wanted to avoid all the bad side effects of mocking, you could run the background task in your test, and have a slow test &hellip; Or, you could use a chain of proxies :</p>

<p>``` ruby
it &lsquo;can override a deep getter&rsquo; do
  allow(RenderingTask).to proxy_message_chain(&ldquo;load.completion_ratio&rdquo;) { |e| e.and_return(0.2523) }</p>

<p>  controller.show</p>

<p>  expect(response).to include(&lsquo;25%&rsquo;)
end
```</p>

<p>Here the simplest thing to do is just to override a small getter, because from a functionnal point of view, that&rsquo;s exactly what we want to test.</p>

<h2>Last word</h2>

<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/philou/rspecproxies">github</a>, v1.0.0 is on <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rspecproxies/versions/0.1.0">rubygems</a>, it requires Ruby v2.2.5 and RSpec v3.5, the license is MIT, help in any form are welcome !</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/my-new-gem-for-creating-rspec-proxies/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-23T06:20:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/my-new-gem-for-creating-rspec-proxies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I already wrote a lot about test proxies (<a href="/how-to-stub-around-a-call-to-the-original-method-with-rspec/">here</a>, <a href="/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">here</a> and <a href="/my-humble-advices-about-how-to-write-maintainable-tests/">here</a>).</p>

<p>I just took the time to transform my previous gist in a full fledged ruby gem. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;rspecproxies&rdquo; and it can be found <a href="https://github.com/philou/rspecproxies">on github</a>. It&rsquo;s fully tested, documented and there&rsquo;s a usage section in the readme to help anyone get started.</p>

<p>Here are the pain points proxies try to fix :</p>

<ul>
<li>Without mocks, it is sometimes just awfully painfull to write the test (do you really want to start a background task just to get a completion ratio ?)</li>
<li>With classic stubs, you sometimes have to stub things you are not interested in in your test, you end up with unmaintainable extra long stub setup</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at a few examples of tests with proxies :</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify actual load count without interfering in any behaviour</li>
</ul>


<p>```ruby
it &lsquo;caches users&rsquo; do
  users = User.capture_results_from(:load)</p>

<p>  controller.login(&lsquo;joe&rsquo;, &lsquo;secret&rsquo;)
  controller.login(&lsquo;joe&rsquo;, &lsquo;secret&rsquo;)</p>

<p>  expect(users).to have_exactly(1).items
end
```</p>

<ul>
<li>Use proxies to stub an object that does not yet exist</li>
</ul>


<p>```ruby
it &lsquo;rounds the completion ratio&rsquo; do
   RenderingTask.proxy_chain(:load, :completion_ratio) {|s| s.and_return(0.2523) }</p>

<p>   renderingController.show</p>

<p>   expect(response).to include(&lsquo;25%&rsquo;)
end
```</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d really love to see more code tested with proxies, it makes the whole testing so much more natural. As with any testing techniques, we get more thorough testing from the ease of writing the test.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/better-error-messages-when-testing-html-views/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-18T21:14:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/better-error-messages-when-testing-html-views</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When testing html views, either from <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> or from <a href="http://rspec.info/">Cucumber</a>, <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath">XPath</a> can be really helpful to quickly find expected elements.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a bit like regular expressions, when you start to use xpath to solve a problem, you often end up with 2 problems &hellip; Part of the reason is that xpaths tend to be cryptic. In the case of testing, error messages coming from unmatched xpath are even more crytic !</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I had the idea for <a href="https://github.com/philou/xpath-specs">xpath-specs</a> : a small gem that allows to associate a description with an xpath, to nest xpaths together, all this to simplify tests and assertion failure reporting.</p>

<p>For example, with an assertion like this :</p>

<p><code>ruby
expect(html).to contain_a(dish_with_name("Grilled Lobster")
</code></p>

<p>Here is the kind of failure message one can get :</p>

<p>```
expected the page to contain a dish that is named Grilled Lobster (//table[@id=&lsquo;dish-panel&rsquo;]//tr[td[contains(.,&lsquo;#{name}&rsquo;)]])</p>

<pre><code>   it found a dish (//table[@id='dish-panel']//tr) :
      &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pizza&lt;/td&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;
   but not a dish that is named Grilled Lobster (//table[@id='dish-panel']//tr[td[contains(.,'#{name}')]])
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>And here is the required setup :</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>spec/support/knows_page_parts.rb</h1>

<p>module KnowsPageParts
  def dish</p>

<pre><code>Xpath::Specs::PagePart.new("a dish", "//table[@id='dish-panel']//tr")
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def dish_with_name(name)</p>

<pre><code>dish.that("is named #{name}", "[td[contains(.,'#{name}')]]")
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/philou/xpath-specs">readme</a> for more details.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/rspec-matchers-combinators-2-spec-combos-gem/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-25T21:29:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/rspec-matchers-combinators-2-spec-combos-gem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I already wrote about my <a href="/rspec-matchers-combinators/">RSpec Matchers Combinators</a>, I decided to extract them into the <a href="https://github.com/philou/spec_combos">spec_combos</a> gem.</p>

<p>To use it, just add the following to your Gemfile :</p>

<p><code>ruby
gem 'spec_combos', :group =&gt; 'test'
</code></p>

<p>Compared to the first version of the matchers, I added better error messages. For example, consider the following complex nested assertion :</p>

<p><code>ruby
expect([1,2,3]).to all_{and_(be_odd, be_instance_of(Fixnum))}
</code></p>

<p>It outputs the following error :</p>

<p>```text
Failure/Error: expect([1,2,3]).to all<em>{and</em>(be_odd, be_instance_of(Fixnum))}
  expected [1, 2, 3] to all be odd and be an instance of Fixnum, but the following were not:</p>

<pre><code>[1] (2): expected 2 to be odd and be an instance of Fixnum, but:
  expected odd? to return true, got false
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>I hope this might help !</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/rspec-matchers-combinators/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-11T12:23:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/rspec-matchers-combinators</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-expectations">Rspec matchers</a> are a lot like predicates. Predicates that can talk &hellip; The good thing about predicates, as anybody who has done a bit of functional programming will tell you, is that they are easy to combine together into bigger predicates. I was really suprised to see that rspec does not come with such simple combinators as &lsquo;and&rsquo; or &lsquo;or&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Here is a gist where I define simple combinators :</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/philou/6521797.js"></script>


<p>With this and the <a href="https://github.com/bmabey/email-spec">email_spec</a> matchers, it is possible to write something like this to find if an email was sent by rails :</p>

<p>```ruby
expect(all_emails).to have_any_that(and_(deliver_to(receiver),</p>

<pre><code>                                     have_subject(subject),
                                     have_body_text(body)))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>It enables expressive test code and high reusability.</p>

<p>Using the &lsquo;all&rsquo; combinator it is possible to write things like that :</p>

<p><code>ruby
expect(sample_items_attributes).to all_ have_key(:price)
</code></p>

<p>I had to prepend &lsquo;all&rsquo; and &lsquo;and&rsquo; with an underscore because I would otherwise get conflicts&hellip; I&rsquo;m not overly satisfied with this, but it will do for the moment.</p>

<p>I was happily supprised by the readability of error messages when the mach fails. Rspec does a very good job about this. I think it would be possible to get even better error messages by explicity using the sub matchers messages though. If anyone is interested, help yourself !</p>
