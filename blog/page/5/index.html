  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, my colleague <a href="https://ahmadatwi.me/">Ahmad Atwi</a> and I went to the London <a href="https://www.spaconference.org/spa2017/">SPA Conference</a> to give our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJsukJhxt7E">Remote eXtreme Practice</a> talk.</p>

<p>The London <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> is one of the most active in the world. You could feel an XP atmosphere at the conference. For example, people like <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/">Nat Pryce</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sf105">Steve Freeman</a>, authors of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321503627&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pbourgau-20&amp;linkId=fcdd83a07a3cfb190f2c8e7e8b9f72c3">GOOSGT</a> book were speakers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321503627&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pbourgau-20&amp;linkId=fcdd83a07a3cfb190f2c8e7e8b9f72c3"><img src="../imgs/2017-07-06-5-spa-conference-takeaways-that-could-make-us-better-software-professionals/growing.jpg" alt="The cover of Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided By Tests" /></a></p>

<p>To summarize, we had the chance to attend a lot of very interesting sessions during the 3 days of the conference. Here are 5 pearls of wisdom I took back with me.</p>

<h2>What connascences are</h2>

<p>Identifying code <a href="http://connascence.io/">connascences</a> helps to rank refactorings and keep the system maintainable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/refactor.html">Continuous refactoring</a> is one of the core practices of XP. For me, knowing what to refactor next has been a matter of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html">code smells</a>, discussing with my pair and gut feeling.</p>

<p>A connascence is a coupling between parts of the system. Two parts of your code are connascent if changing one implies changing the other. For example, a function call is connascent by name with the function definition. If you change one, you need to change the other.</p>

<p>Connascences are more formal than code smells. We can detect and rank them to pick the most important refactoring to do. People have listed 9 types of connascences. Some are visible in the source code, others are dynamic and difficult to spot before runtime.</p>

<p>The lowest form of connascence is <a href="http://connascence.io/name.html">&lsquo;of name&rsquo;,</a> like in the function call example above. The worst form is <a href="http://connascence.io/identity.html">&lsquo;of Identity&rsquo;</a>, when different parts of the system must reference the same object.</p>

<p>The higher the connascence, the more difficult it is to evolve the parts involved. Instead of relying on intuition, you can use a connascence based refactoring algorithm :</p>

<ol>
<li>Detect the highest connascence</li>
<li>Reduce or remove it</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>


<p>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/xpsurgery">Kevin Rutherford</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mowat27">Adrian Mowat</a> for your <a href="http://xpsurgery.com/resources/connascence-hunt-slides/">Red Green then what ?</a> session about connascence.</p>

<h2>Tips for pairing with junior developers</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/irinatsyganok">Irina Tsyganok</a> and <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/">Nat Pryce</a> gave a very fun session about this topic. A lot of valuable points discussed, from which I saved a few pearls of wisdom.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cat eating session from <a href="https://twitter.com/natpryce">@natpryce</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/spaconf17?src=hash">#spaconf17</a> (unless <a href="https://twitter.com/irinatsyganok">@irinatsyganok</a> stops him) <a href="https://t.co/XSiaPDp9kJ">pic.twitter.com/XSiaPDp9kJ</a></p>&mdash; Andy Longshaw (@andylongshaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/andylongshaw/status/879714743963054080">27 juin 2017</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>It was reassuring to hear Nat saying that &ldquo;As we gain experience, we are not expected to know everything&rdquo;. Pairing with developers out of college is an occasion to &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; skills. Hard learned design skills versus updates on the latest technologies.</p>

<p>I also learned about the <a href="http://actingcoachscotland.co.uk/blog/expert-induced-amnesia/">Expert&rsquo;s Amnesia</a> and why experts often have a hard time teaching. Expert level knowledge is by nature instinctive. At this level of skill, it becomes very difficult to detail the logic of things that seem obvious.</p>

<h2>We engineers are more mentors than coaches</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201616416/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201616416&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pbourgau-20&amp;linkId=dc2f9dc4f5ca106842921bfded07b405">first XP book</a>, there were only 3 roles in the team : team members, on site customer and XP coach. The XP coach should be a developer who can help the team to learn the practices and principles of XP.</p>

<p>About the same time, the personal or professional coach jobs appeared. The Scrum Master, is to Scrum what the XP coach is to XP, without the developer part. Remember the joke &ldquo;Scrum is like XP, without everything that makes it work&rdquo; (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html">Flaccid Scrum</a>).</p>

<p>It looks like the Agile Coach job title appeared out of all this. The problem is no one exactly knows what this is. Should he be an experienced developer like the XP coach ? A great people person ? Or someone good at introducing change ? or a mix of these ?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.selfishprogramming.com/about/">Portia Tung</a> and <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/helenlisowski">Helen Lisowski</a> &rsquo;s  talk &ldquo;The power of coaching&rdquo; clarified that.</p>

<p>There is no knowledge transfer from the coach to the coachees ! On the other side, a mentor does transfer knowledge to his mentees. The coach helps his coachee take a step back and take decisions in full consciousness. The goal of the mentor is to inspire and train to new techniques.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fine being a mentor and not a coach ;&ndash;)</p>

<h2>Servant leaders need to be tough at times</h2>

<p>We hear a lot about servant leadership nowadays. Scrum Master should be servant leaders, as well as managers in agile organizations.</p>

<p><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/company/bellebeck-limited">Angie Main</a> gave a very interesting session about servant leadership. She made an interesting point I had not heard about before. We all know that servant leaders should trust the team to get the work done most of the time. In spite of that, servant leaders must also be ready to step in and remove people who don&rsquo;t fit in and endanger the team !</p>

<p>This reminded me of what Jim Collins says in <a href="http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Built_to_Last#Chapter_6_.E2.80.93_Cult-like_Cultures">Built to last</a> : &ldquo;People who don&rsquo;t fit are expelled like viruses !&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060516402/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060516402&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pbourgau-20&amp;linkId=e83ad8e3dcf7bdb7f875d5b22e8eb4c6"><img src="../imgs/2017-07-06-5-spa-conference-takeaways-that-could-make-us-better-software-professionals/built-to-last.jpg" alt="The cover of Built to Last" /></a></p>

<h2>1/3000 ideas succeeds</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ozzieyuce">Ozlem Yuce</a>&rsquo;s session, I learned about the &ldquo;Job To Be Done&rdquo; technique to understand the customer&rsquo;s real needs.</p>

<p>Studies measured that only 1 idea out of 3000 ends up as a successful product ! <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=56217976614325233f8b4567&amp;assetKey=AS%3A285916150157312%401445179130594">Here</a> seems to be the original research.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll remember this fact next time I&rsquo;m ask for a funky feature !</p>

<h2>To conclude</h2>

<p>At the end, we had a very good time at SPAconference. The talks were insightful, we had interesting discussions, the premises were comfortable and on top of that, food was great !</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m already eager to go to SPA conference 2018 !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As long as you are writing your tests before your code and doing regular refactoring, you are doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> !</p>

<p>The Red &ndash; Green &ndash; Refactor loop is useful to introduce TDD to new developers. Different loops can be more effective in real world situation.</p>

<p>The Red &ndash; Green &ndash; Refactor loop is not a dogma !</p>

<p><a href="http://www.natpryce.com/"><img src="../imgs/2017-06-28-dont-stick-to-tdds-red-green-refactor-loop-to-the-letter/red-green-refactor.jpg" alt="The famous red, green, refactor TDD loop" /></a></p>

<h2>Refactor &ndash; Red &ndash; Green</h2>

<p>When I work on a story, I very often keep a TODO list next to my desk. I use it to keep track of the next steps, the edge cases to test, the code smells and refactorings to do.</p>

<p>When I get to the end of the story, all that remains of this list is a few refactorings. Very often, I don&rsquo;t do them !</p>

<p>With the feature working, doing these refactorings feels like violation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>. Next time we&rsquo;ll have to work on this part of the code, we&rsquo;ll have a story to serve as guide to which refactorings to do.</p>

<p>The same thing is effective at the unit test scale. It&rsquo;s easier to refactor when you know the test you want to add. Refactor to make this test easy to write !</p>

<p>Here is an example with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">Fizz Buzz</a></p>

<p>Here is the test I&rsquo;d like to add. </p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Unfortunately, fizzBuzz needs to return a String instead of an integer for it to compile. That&rsquo;s when I would refactor before adding the new test.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the end, this loop is very like the classic TDD loop :</p>

<p>A bit more YAGNI, that&rsquo;s all.</p>

<h2>Red &ndash; Better Red &ndash; Green &ndash; Refactor</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="/speed-up-the-tdd-feedback-loop-with-better-assertion-messages/">I wrote about error messages in unit tests</a>. To summarize, extra work on error messages reduces the testing feedback loop.</p>

<p>We can translate this focus on error messages into an extra TDD step. Whatever the TDD loop you are using, you can add this step after the Red step.</p>

<h2><del>Red</del> &ndash; Green &ndash; Refactor &ndash; Red &ndash; Green</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it makes sense to refactor before fixing the test. The idea is to rely on the existing tests to prepare the code to fix the new test in one line.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take our Fizz Buzz example again. Imagine we finished the kata, when we decide to tweak the rules and try Fizz Buzz Bang. We should now print Bang on multiples of 7.</p>

<p>Here is our starting point :</p>

<p>I could go through all the hoops, 7, 14, then 3<em>7, 5</em>7 and finally 3<em>5</em>7 &hellip; By now, I should know the music though !</p>

<p>What I would do in this case is :</p>

<ul>
<li>first to comment the new failing test to get back to green</li>
<li>refactor the code to prepare for the new code</li>
<li>uncomment the failing test</li>
<li>fix it</li>
</ul>


<p>In our example, here is the refactoring I would do</p>

<p>From there, fixing the test is dead simple.</p>

<p>In practice I find this loop very useful. At local scale as we saw but it&rsquo;s also a great way to refactor your architecture at larger scale.</p>

<p>One downsize is that if you are not careful, it might lead to over-engineering. Be warned, keep an eye on that !</p>

<p>Last caveat : not all TDD interviewers like this technique &hellip;</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t obsess</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not because you are not following the Red Green Refactor loop to the letter that you are not doing TDD.</p>

<p>An interesting point is that these variations to the TDD loop are combinable ! Experienced TDD practitioners can jump from one to the other without even noticing.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/06/13/a-dissection-of-the-test-driven-development-process-does-it-really-matter-to-test-first-or-test-last/">This paper</a> argues that as long as you write the tests along (before or after) the code, you get the same benefit. That&rsquo;s not going to make me stop writing my tests first, but it is interesting. That would mean that even a Code &ndash; Test &ndash; Refactor loop would be ok if it is fast enough !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As <a href="/side-projects-matter/">I said last week</a>, I released the v0.1 of <a href="https://philous-planning-poker.herokuapp.com/">Philou&rsquo;s Planning Poker</a>, my latest side project. Although I have a day job, a wife, a family and a mortgage to pay, I still manage to finish my side projects. In the past 7 years, I published 5 of these as open source projects, website, or wannabe businesses.</p>

<p>Side projects rely on 2 things : time and motivation. If motivation goes down, you&rsquo;ll  stop working on it, and it will die. If you don&rsquo;t manage to find enough time for it, it will also die.</p>

<p>Over the years, I accumulated best practices that increase the chances of success. Here is a shortlist of 13 of these.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/"><img src="../imgs/2017-06-19-13-tricks-for-successful-side-projects/Strip-Side-project.jpg" alt="A comic strip about side projects" /></a></p>

<h2>1. Know your goal</h2>

<p>As I said before, side projects are time constrained. If you try to follow many goals at once, you&rsquo;ll spread too thin and won&rsquo;t deliver anything. That will kill your motivation.</p>

<p>To avoid this, you need to decide on a unique goal for your project. It can be anything : learning a new tech, building a tool, sell a simple product, maintain a blog.</p>

<p>Depending on the nature of your goal, your side project can take different forms. <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-i-got-my-feet-wet-with-machine-learning-with-the-first-20-hours/">20 hours experiments</a> are great for learning new techs. As a side note, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MOOC">MOOCs</a> can also be very effective for this. If you want to start a business, start a <a href="http://www.allencheng.com/concierge-mvp/">lean startup concierge MVP</a>. Finally, if you already know users who need a tool, build a minimalistic version for them.</p>

<h2>2. Time box your work</h2>

<p>Time boxing will force you to make the choices that will keep you going forward. The risk is to take on too many topics : more refactoring, more UI polish, more options, more bells and whistles. All these can be very interesting and valuable, but are usually not the main priority.</p>

<p>20 hours programs are time boxes, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons they work. For other kinds of side projects, I do a quarterly prioritization. &ldquo;This is what I&rsquo;d like to have in 3 months&rdquo;. I often slip a bit, but that&rsquo;s not a problem as long as I stay focused on my goal.</p>

<h2>3. Setup a routine</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to dedicate time to your side project. Think of what you could do if you worked one hour per day to it. 365 hours per year, or 90 hours per quarter ! That&rsquo;s 2 full weeks of work !</p>

<p>In the long run, having a routine is more effective than anything else. After a few weeks of sticking to a routine, it will become part of your daily life, and won&rsquo;t be an effort anymore. It will also help to forecast what you&rsquo;ll be able to do in the coming month or so.</p>

<p>To setup a routine, block a slot in your day to work on your project, and stick to it. My own routine is waking up early to have some focused time. I have entrepreneur friends who did the same. <a href="http://grasshopper.com/">GrassHopper</a> founder says the same in this <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/003-david-hauser-of-grasshopper">Indiehacker podcast</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Keep delivering to sustain motivation</h2>

<p>Nothing kills motivation as not delivering. At work, I can go on without user feedback for a while (<a href="/how-long-can-your-inner-drive-last/">not too long though</a>). Unfortunately, that does not work on a time constrained side project. We have only one life and we don&rsquo;t want to spend our time on things that don&rsquo;t matter. Things that don&rsquo;t deliver don&rsquo;t matter &hellip;</p>

<p>To get the technical aspect of delivery out of the picture once and for all, I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498106027&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=continuous+delivery">Continuous Delivery</a>. Continuous Delivery is pretty easy to start with on a new project :</p>

<ul>
<li>automate all your tests</li>
<li>setup a CI server</li>
<li>deploy when the CI passes</li>
</ul>


<p>Once this is up and running, as long as I split my work in baby steps, I&rsquo;ll be delivering.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498106027&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=continuous+delivery"><img src="../imgs/2017-06-19-13-tricks-for-successful-side-projects/continuous-delivery.jpg" alt="The cover of the continuous delivery book" /></a></p>

<h2>5. Use SasS tools</h2>

<p>Setting up a CI and a deployment server can take some time. In 2017 though, online platforms make this very easy. Use as many as you can.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://philous-planning-poker.herokuapp.com/">Philou&rsquo;s Planning Poker</a>, I save my code on <a href="https://github.com/philou/planning-poker">Github</a>, test through <a href="https://travis-ci.org/philou/planning-poker">Travis CI</a> and deploy to <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com">Heroku</a>. I also use <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/philou/planning-poker">Code Climate</a> for static code analysis.</p>

<p>Most of these tools have some free plans for small or open source projects. That alone is a great advantage of making your project open source !</p>

<h2>6. Pay for good tools</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to make your project open source, consider paying for these services. How much you value your time will tell you whether to buy or not.</p>

<p>There are other things you should pay for as well. I definitely recommend paying for a good laptop and IDE.</p>

<p>Remember, anything that helps you to deliver also helps you to keep your motivation high. You have a day job that earns you money, so use it !</p>

<h2>7. Pick a productive language </h2>

<p>Depending on your project, you&rsquo;ll have a choice in which programming language to use.</p>

<p>Paul Graham advices to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">use dynamic languages</a>. I tend to do the same, especially after watching <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/dynamic-static-typing">&ldquo;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Dynamic Typing for Practical Programs&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/dynamic-static-typing"><img src="../imgs/2017-06-19-13-tricks-for-successful-side-projects/dynamic-typing-pres.jpg" alt="A presentation about dynamic typing" /></a></p>

<p>In the end, I guess it&rsquo;s a matter of personal preference. Pick the language you&rsquo;ll be the most productive with.</p>

<h2>8. Use a popular platform</h2>

<p>Use a popular open source platform to build your side project on. Useless to say, if your goal is to learn X, use X, even if it is not popular !</p>

<p>There are many advantages to using a popular platform :</p>

<ul>
<li>you&rsquo;ll have something that has already been production proofed</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll suffer less bugs (remember Linus&rsquo;s Law <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law">&ldquo;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&rdquo;</a>)</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll get help from the community</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll find compatible libraries to solve some of your problems</li>
</ul>


<p>The end goal is always the same : sustain your motivation by delivering fast enough !</p>

<h2>9. Walk the edge</h2>

<p>We don&rsquo;t start side project to spend time updating dependencies. The saying goes <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.html">&ldquo;If it hurts, do it more often&rdquo;</a>. To save your productivity and motivation, always keep your dependencies up to date.</p>

<p>This is easy with automated test and continuous integration in place. I use no version constraint, but update all dependencies at least every week. I  commit if all tests pass. Sometimes I fall into small 5 to 10 minutes fixes, but that&rsquo;s all it takes.</p>

<h2>10. Take technical debt</h2>

<p>When starting a new side project, you have no ideas how long it will last. Could be one week, for example if you started a 20h experiment at the beginning of holidays. Could also be 20 years, if you managed to transform this side project into a full fledged business.</p>

<p>Starting with all the practices that make large software systems manageable will fail. You won&rsquo;t deliver fast enough. By now, you know the story, if you don&rsquo;t deliver, you&rsquo;ll lose your motivation.</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/a-seamless-way-to-keep-track-of-technical-debt-in-your-source-code/"><code>TODO</code> comments</a> in my latest side project to keep track of the shortcut I took. I found it had 2 main advantages in my situation :</p>

<ul>
<li>I had a quick view of how much total technical debt I took</li>
<li>if things get more serious, it will be easy to find improvement points</li>
</ul>


<p>I know that <code>TODO</code> comments are <a href="https://techbeacon.com/useless-comments-can-ruin-code-review-heres-how-erase-them">controversial in the software community</a>. In the context of new side projects though, they make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>My advice is to take technical debt !</p>

<h2>11. Use your day job</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying to use time from your day job to work on your side project. That would be like stealing. Your day job can help your side project in many other ways.</p>

<p>One I already mentioned is using your income to buy better tools.</p>

<p>If you have <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack Time</a> at your day job, you could use it to start a side project that benefits your company. You&rsquo;ll need to make sure that this kind of arrangement does not pose any IP issues. It can result in a win-win situation.</p>

<p>Another way is to find subjects at work which will grow some skills that are also useful for your side project.</p>

<h2>12. Talk about it</h2>

<p>Talking about your side project serves many purposes :</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s an unofficial engagement to work on it</li>
<li>it provides feedback</li>
<li>it could attract early users</li>
</ul>


<p>To summarize, the more you&rsquo;ll talk about it the more it will become &lsquo;real&rsquo;. You can share your side project anywhere : blog, Meetups, work, with friends or family. Depending on your topic, some places will work better than others.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid that one might steal your idea. A side project is small, not yet rocket science. It&rsquo;s usually too small to be on the radar of serious businesses, and too big for individuals.</p>

<p>Let me explain that. Very few people have the grit to turn their ideas into something real. If you encounter someone who has the grit and the interest, ask her to join forces !</p>

<h2>13. Find real users</h2>

<p>Deploying your software is nice, but it&rsquo;s useless until you have users. Find some ! It&rsquo;s never too early to find testers. If your first demo does not embarrass you, it was too late ! At the beginning, it can be as basic as walking through an unfinished feature to get feedback.</p>

<p>Real user feedback always results in both high motivation and value. There are many places to get beta users : at work, through friends &hellip; have the courage to ask !</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s again a case for building your system in baby steps. The faster you get to something you can show, the faster you can have beta users.</p>

<h2>Do it !</h2>

<p>If I needed a 14th best practice it would be to start today ! As with most things, just do it !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a manager, you could benefit a lot from helping your developers with their side projects.</p>

<p>I finished my <a href="https://philous-planning-poker.herokuapp.com/">latest side project</a>. That&rsquo;s the fifth serious one I bring to an end :</p>

<ol>
<li>2010-2014 <a href="/rip-mes-courses-dot-fr/">www.mes-courses.fr</a>, an improved UI for online groceries. This was both a technical project and a wannabe business</li>
<li>Since 2011, <a href="/">this blog</a></li>
<li>2015 <a href="/agileavatars-dot-com-magnets-for-real/">www.agileavatars.com</a>, a custom magnet shop for agile team boards. This was a lean startup style business project</li>
<li>2016 <a href="/verify-the-big-o-complexity-of-ruby-code-in-rspec/">complexity-asserts</a> a unit test matcher to enforce algorithm complexity. This was a technical project time boxed to 20h.</li>
<li>2016-2017 <a href="/planning-poker/">Philou&rsquo;s Planning Poker</a>, a technical product, that I built to solve my own problem.</li>
</ol>


<p>The more I do side projects, the more I am certain of their value to my employer.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-06-13-side-projects-matter/side-project.jpg" alt="Hand drawing with stating 'creative business idea'" /><div class="image-credits"><a href='http://fr.freepik.com/vecteurs-libre/dessines-a-la-main-business-icons_769576.htm'>Designed by Freepik</a></div></p>

<h2>Reasons companies discourage side projects</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, most companies discourage their employees to have side projects. It boils down to fundamental fears :</p>

<ul>
<li>they might get less done</li>
<li>they might leave</li>
</ul>


<p>While these are legitimate, most of the time, they are also unlikely or short sighted.</p>

<h3>Why don&rsquo;t they work extra hours ?</h3>

<p>Said another way : if developers want to code, why don&rsquo;t they add new features to the company&rsquo;s products ?</p>

<p>From my own experience, having a side project has always been an <a href="/is-there-any-room-for-the-not-passionate-developer/">energy booster</a>. Side projects have made me more effective at work !</p>

<p>For a compulsive hacker, a side project is a hobby ! As painting, piano or soccer is to others. Working on smaller software, being in full control, renews the joy of programming.</p>

<h3>They&rsquo;ll quit once they&rsquo;ve learned new skills !</h3>

<p>Simply said, if a company&rsquo;s retention strategy is to deprecate its developers &hellip; It&rsquo;s got problems a lot worse than a few people doing side projects at night !</p>

<h3>They won&rsquo;t be as productive !</h3>

<p>You could think that developers will be less focused on the company&rsquo;s issues while at work. Indeed, passionate side-project hackers always have it on top of their heads.</p>

<p>Most of the time though, the extra energy provided by the side project out-weights this focus loss.</p>

<p>In the end, we should trust people to be professional. Let&rsquo;s deal with the problem later, when someone actually starts to underdeliver.</p>

<h3>They&rsquo;ll leave if it turns into a successful product !</h3>

<p>Building a product company is pretty damn hard. A time starved side project is pretty unlikely to turn into a successful business. Not much to worry about here ! If it happens, the company is lucky to have had such a productive employee.</p>

<h3>They might steal our intellectual property !</h3>

<p>This one is true. Only a very small minority of people might do that, but the risk remains.</p>

<p>You might conclude that it&rsquo;s easier to play it safe and prohibit side projects &hellip; at the same time, it&rsquo;s always sad to punish the majority for a minority&rsquo;s bad behavior.</p>

<p>It boils down to a tradeoff between risks and rewards. How sensible the company is to IP theft vs the benefits of having a side-project friendly policy.</p>

<p>If you are wondering what these benefits are, read on !</p>

<h2>Side projects made me a more valuable employee</h2>

<p>As developers, side project teach us a lot. What is less obvious, is how these new skills benefit our employers !</p>

<h3>Keep up with technology</h3>

<p>A side project is an occasion to work on any subject, with any technology we want. That&rsquo;s the perfect time to try that latest <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/javascript-frameworks/">JS</a> framework we cannot use at work.</p>

<p>This will help us and our companies to transition to these new technologies in the future.</p>

<p>Experimenting different platforms also widens our horizons. It teaches us new ways of addressing problems in our daily stack. For examples, learning <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/267862/what-makes-lisp-macros-so-special">LISP macros</a> pushed me to use lambdas to create new control structures in Java, C++ or C#.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that side projects make people more productive and adaptive. Which in turn makes companies more productive and resilient</p>

<h3>Understand what technical debt is</h3>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-06-13-side-projects-matter/iceberg-technical-debt.jpg" alt="A technical debt iceberg" /><div class="image-credits"><a href='https://www.vectorcast.com/testing-solutions/technical-debt-legacy-code'>Image from Vector Software</a></div></p>

<p>The bottleneck in a side project is always time. In this context, to deliver fast enough to keep my motivation high, I tend to take technical debt. Particularly because I ignore how long I&rsquo;ll be maintaining this code.</p>

<p>Even so, if I later decide to stick to this side project, this technical debt will be an issue.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what technical debt is : a conscious choice to cut a corner and fix it later. Without keeping track of the cut corners, it&rsquo;s not debt anymore, but crappy code ! That&rsquo;s why I ended up using <a href="/a-seamless-way-to-keep-track-of-technical-debt-in-your-source-code/"><code>#TODO</code> comments</a> in my side projects.</p>

<p>Later down the road, at any moment, I can decide to invest in refactoring some technical debt out. We can apply the exact same principles at our day jobs.</p>

<h3>Understanding what a business is</h3>

<p>Trying to make money from your side project taught me other kind of lessons. To sell my product or service, I had to learn a ton of other skills than the typical developer has. Nothing will sell without marketing or sales. I also had to dip my toes in design, web content creation and project management.</p>

<p>Once I went through this, I was able to better understand a big picture at work. It became easier to discuss with product, project and sales people. I&rsquo;m able to make better tradeoffs between engineering, product and technical debt. Non technical colleagues appreciate that. As developers, it increases our value and trustworthiness.</p>

<h3>Discover new ways of doing things</h3>

<p>While progressing towards my own side project goals, I had to search the internet for help on some tasks. I ended up using SaaS tools, and discovered alternate practices to the ones I was using in my daily job.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great for employers ! Developers will gain perspective about which company processes work well and which don&rsquo;t. If you have some form of continuous improvement in place at work, they&rsquo;ll suggest great ideas ! If you don&rsquo;t, then you should <a href="/how-we-introduced-efficient-agile-retrospectives/">start doing retrospectives</a> now !</p>

<h2>Companies should sponsor side projects</h2>

<p>I hope I convinced you that side projects are at least as efficient as a formal training. The topics are unknown at the beginning, but that&rsquo;s the trick : they deal with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">unknown unknowns</a> !</p>

<p>There are many ways a company can help its employees with their side projects :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack time</a> is a great way to spark the interest in a topic. Developers might start something in their slack time, and continue as a side project. Provided the topic as value for the company, they could continue using their Slack time on it.</li>
<li>Hosting a <a href="https://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathon</a>. Most company offices are empty on Saturdays and Sundays. You could ask your company to lend its premises for such an event. It&rsquo;s very likely that some employees will take part.</li>
<li>Even better, some companies, like <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2013/02/15/organizing-a-hack-week/">Spotify</a>, organize regular Hackathons <em>on office hours</em> ! That&rsquo;s Slack time, on steroids !</li>
<li>Sponsoring internal communities can enable employees with side-projects to help each other. Sponsorship could be free lunch, premises or a regular small slice of time on work hours.</li>
<li>Providing a clear legal framework around side projects reduces the risks for everyone. Questions like the ownership of intellectual property are better dealt with upfront.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a developer looking for a side project idea, suggest slack time in retrospective ! You could also ask for sponsorship and organize a startup week-end or a lunch time community.</p>

<p>Finally, if your company is side-project friendly, communicate about it ! It&rsquo;s a great selling point and it will attract great programmers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a rather widespread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> practice to have a <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/7823/is-it-ok-to-have-multiple-asserts-in-a-single-unit-test">single assertion per test</a>. The goal is to have faster feedback loop while coding. When a test fails, it can be for a single reason, making the diagnostic faster.</p>

<p>The same goes with the test names. When a test fails, a readable test name in the report simplifies the diagnostic. Some testing frameworks allow the use of plain strings as test names. In others, people use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming">underscores</a>#Multiple-word_identifiers) instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">CamelCase</a> in test names.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-05-29-speed-up-the-tdd-feedback-loop-with-better-assertion-messages/rubymine.jpg" alt="RubyMine test report" /></p>

<h2>A 4th step in TDD: Fail, <em>Fail better</em>, Pass, Refactor</h2>

<h3>First, make it fail</h3>

<p>Everyone knows that Test Driven Development starts by making the test fail. Let me illustrate why.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I was working on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29">C#</a> project. We were using TDD and <a href="https://github.com/nunit/nunit">NUnit</a>. At some point, while working on a story, I forgot to make my latest test fail. I wrote some code to pass this test, I ran the tests, and they were green. When I was almost done, I tried to plug all the parts together, but nothing was working. I had to start the debugger to understand what was going wrong. At first, I could not understand why the exact thing I had unit tested earlier was now broken. After more investigation I discovered that I had forgotten to make my test public. NUnit only runs public tests &hellip;</p>

<p>If I had made sure my test was failing, I would have spotted straightaway that it was not ran.</p>

<h3>Then make it fail &hellip; better !</h3>

<p>I lived the same kind of story with wrong failures many times. The test fails, but for a bad reason. I move on to implement the code to fix it &hellip; but it still does not pass ! Only then do I check the error message and discover the real thing to fix. Again, it&rsquo;s a transgression to baby steps and to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a> principle. If the tests is small, that might not be too much of an issue. But it can be if the test is big, or if the real fix deprecates all the premature work.</p>

<h3>Strive for explicit error message</h3>

<p>The idea is to make sure to have good enough error messages before moving on to the &ldquo;pass&rdquo; step.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080583&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-29-speed-up-the-tdd-feedback-loop-with-better-assertion-messages/growing.jpg" alt="Cover of GOOSGT" /></a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing groundbreaking about this practice. It&rsquo;s not a step as explicit as the other 3 steps of TDD. The first place I read about this idea was in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080583&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests</a>.</p>

<h2>How to improve your messages</h2>

<h3>Readable code</h3>

<p>Some test frameworks print out the failed assertion code to the test failure report. Others, especially in dynamic languages, use the assertion code itself to deduce an error message. If your test code is readable enough, your error messages might be as well !</p>

<p>For example, with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> testing framework :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;must have an ending&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Vote</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">team</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="vi">@daltons</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">be_valid</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yield the following error :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">expected</span> <span class="c1">#&lt;Vote ...&gt; to be valid, but got errors: Ending can&#39;t be blank</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Pass in a message argument</h3>

<p>Sometimes, readable code is not enough to provide good messages. All testing frameworks I know provide some way to pass in a custom error message. That&rsquo;s often a cheap and straightforward way to clarify your test reports.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;should not render anything&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">post_create</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">HTTP</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Status</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">OK</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_s</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>                             <span class="s2">&quot;expected the post to succeed, but got http status </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yields</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">expected</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">post</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">succeed</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">got</span> <span class="n">http</span> <span class="n">status</span> <span class="mi">204</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Define your own matchers</h3>

<p>The drawback with explicit error message is that they harm code readability. If this becomes too much of an issue, one last solution is the use of <a href="https://objectpartners.com/2013/09/18/the-benefits-of-using-assertthat-over-other-assert-methods-in-unit-tests/">test matchers</a>. A test matcher is a class encapsulating assertion code. The test framework provides a fluent api to bind a matcher with the actual and expected values. Almost all test framework support some flavor of these. If not, or if you want more, there are libraries that do :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/index.html">AssertJ</a> is a fluent assertion library for Java. You can easily extend it with your own assertions (ie. matchers)</li>
<li><a href="http://n-fluent.net/">NFluent</a> is the same thing for .Net.</li>
</ul>


<p>As an example, in a past side project, I defined an <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/blob/master/spec/support/include_all_matcher.rb">include_all</a> rspec matcher that verifies that many elements are present in a collection. It can be used that way :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">include_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;Tomatoes&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Bananas&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Potatoes&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It yields error messages like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;Bananas&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Potatoes&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="n">are</span> <span class="n">missing</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A custom matcher is more work, but it provides both readable code and clean error messages.</p>

<h2>Other good points of matchers</h2>

<p>Like any of these 3 tactics, matchers provide better error messages. Explicit error messages, in turn, speed up the diagnostic on regression. In the end, faster diagnostic means easier maintenance.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s more awesomness in custom test matchers !</p>

<h3>Adaptive error messages</h3>

<p>In a custom matcher, you have to write code to generate the error message. This means we can add logic there ! It&rsquo;s an opportunity to build more detailed error messages.</p>

<p>This can be particularly useful when testing recursive (tree-like) structures. A few years ago, I wrote an rspec matcher library called <a href="https://github.com/philou/xpath-specs">xpath-specs</a>. It checks html views for the presence of recursive XPath. Instead of printing</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Could</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">find</span> <span class="sr">//</span><span class="n">table</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="vi">@id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;grades&quot;</span><span class="o">]//</span><span class="n">span</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;Joe&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It will print</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Could</span> <span class="n">find</span> <span class="sr">//</span><span class="n">table</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="vi">@id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;grades&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="sr">//</span><span class="n">table</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="vi">@id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;grades&quot;</span><span class="o">]//</span><span class="n">span</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;Joe&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>(BTW, I&rsquo;m still wondering if testing views this way is a good idea &hellip;)</p>

<h3>Test code reuse</h3>

<p>One of the purpose of custom test matchers is to be reusable. That&rsquo;s a good place to factorize assertion code. It is both more readable and more organized than extracting an assertion method.</p>

<h3>Better coverage</h3>

<p>I noticed that custom matcher have a psychological effect on test coverage ! A matcher is a place to share assertion code. Adding thorough assertions seems legitimate, contrary to repeating them inline.</p>

<h3>Avoids mocking</h3>

<p>We often resort to mocks instead of side effect tests because it&rsquo;s a lot shorter. A custom matcher encapsulates the assertion code. It makes it OK to use a few assertions to test for side effects, which is usually preferable to mocking.</p>

<p>For example, here is a matcher that checks that our remote service API received the correct calls, without doing any mocking.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2>Care about error messages</h2>

<p>Providing good error messages is a small effort compared to unit testing in general. At the same time, it speeds up the feedback loop, both while coding and during later maintenance. Imagine how easier it would be to analyze and fix regressions if they all had clear error messages !</p>

<p>Spread the word ! Leave comments in code reviews, demo the practice to your pair buddy. Prepare a team coding dojo about custom assertion matchers. Discuss the issue in a retro !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> a long time ago. Since then, even though I&rsquo;m still not a master, it&rsquo;s been my most useful programming skill, by far. TDD is the first trick every new programmer should learn. It made my whole career as a developer easier.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a professional software engineer for more than 15 years, including around 10 years in the trading industry. Only once did I need to work on week ends or late into the night to fix emergency issues. I believe I largely owe this work-life balance to the high test coverage that TDD ensures by design.</p>

<p>TDD also enables safe refactoring. Refactoring enables <a href="/incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/">incremental design</a> which lets you decide late. Deciding late is how you make your customers happy by accepting late changes. Deciding late is how take up-front design easy, and improve your code as you go. Deciding late is how you build trustful and harmonious relationships with the stakeholders of your project.</p>

<p>Finally, writing tests before the code is both easier and more fun. Among compilation errors and never ending customer demands, the recurring green barre tastes like pure candy to the poor programmer !</p>

<h2>The TDD Road</h2>

<p>Here are the steps I took to learn TDD.</p>

<h3>Learn the principles</h3>

<p>The principles of Test Driven Development are fairly basic. 5 minutes is enough to know them forever :</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a failing test</li>
<li>Make it pass by doing the simplest thing possible</li>
<li>Refactor your code while keeping the tests passing</li>
<li>Repeat until your acceptance test is green</li>
</ol>


<p>TDD newbies might ask a few questions like :</p>

<ul>
<li>Is making the code compile in step 1 or 2 ? Honestly, that does not matter. Write the test as if you had the code, then make it compile, make sure it fails, and continue.</li>
<li>How much should I refactor ? It often takes a good amount of experimentation to find your good balance. If you don&rsquo;t refactor enough, you going to drown in dirty code. If you refactor too much, you&rsquo;re going to waste your time (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html">YAGNI</a>). As a rule of thumb, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html">Kent Beck&rsquo;s</a> rules on simple design are a very good starting point :</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/beck-rules.jpg" alt="A visual graph of Kent Beck's rules of simple design" /></a><div class="image-credits"><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html">From Martin Fowler : Beck Design Rules</a></div></p>

<h3>Find your tools</h3>

<p>Back in 2003, after reading <a href="TODO">Martin Fowler</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080119&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=martin+fowler+refactoring">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a> book, I decided to give TDD a serious try. I was using C++ at work but we did not even have a nightly build. I had to download and setup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CppUnit">CppUnit</a> on my own. As solo endeavor, this was a required step to get into TDD.</p>

<p>Find and setup a tool. Which one should be rather obvious, if your team already uses a unit test framework, stick to it, otherwise, pick the most standard for your language, ex : <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> for <a href="https://www.java.com">Java</a> (you might as well start searching for a new job where they use a unit testing tool).</p>

<h3>Train at a TDD coding dojo</h3>

<p><a href="http://codingdojo.org/">Coding dojos</a> were first invented as a tool to <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/">learn TDD</a>. They were started by two french eXtreme Programmers <a href="https://ut7.fr/">Emmanuel Gaillot</a> and <a href="http://institut-agile.fr/">Laurent Bossavit</a>. It happens that I live in Paris, and that Emmanuel came to work as a contractor at the same company I was. I learned that he was organizing a weekly coding dojo open to any developer. That&rsquo;s how I started attending coding dojos. Looking back, the TDD skills I learned at the coding dojo are just enormous !</p>

<p>If you are serious about learning TDD, attend coding dojos. Whether you find one in your city (ask <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a>) or in your company does not really matter. If you cannot find any, just start one at work ! Send a public call for interested people (use wiki, mail, posters or whatever), book a room and start hacking ! <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Dojo-Handbook-Emily-Bache/dp/919811803X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494908749&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coding+dojo">Emily Bache&rsquo;s Coding Dojo Handbook</a> seems a very good reference about how to start a coding dojo (Disclaimer : I did not read the book, I only know it by reputation.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Dojo-Handbook-Emily-Bache/dp/919811803X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494908749&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coding+dojo"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/coding-dojo.jpg" alt="Cover of The Coding Dojo Handbook" /></a></p>

<h3>Use it</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a professional programmer, you must be spending most of your time writing code. Take this opportunity to use TDD. You&rsquo;ll be slowed down a bit at the beginning, but as both your code and your skills improve, you&rsquo;ll get your time back manyfold.</p>

<p>I remember one of my first professional use of TDD was to write a small parser. A few weeks later I was asked to make it faster. Having tests around it made it easy to optimize it without breaking it.</p>

<h3>Deliberate practice</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-20-Hours-Learn-Anything/dp/1591846943/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494910468&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+first+20+hours">The first 20 hours</a>, Josh Kaufman explains that deliberately practicing specific topics is a more time effective way of learning than simply crunching hours of practice.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/tpierrain">Thomas Pierrain</a> is used to regularly practice short 30 minutes katas to sharpen his programming skills. Katas can be found at <a href="http://codingdojo.org/KataCatalogue/">codingdojo.org</a>, at <a href="http://cyber-dojo.org/">cyber-dojo.org</a> or in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Dojo-Handbook-Emily-Bache/dp/919811803X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494908749&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coding+dojo">The Coding Dojo Handbook</a>.</p>

<h3>Read</h3>

<p>Meanwhile I was doing all this, I also spent a lot of time reading on the subject. At the time, there was a lot of things about TDD in the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/">C2 Wiki</a>, so I spent a lot of time there. Since then, I stumbled upon a few books that helped me to understand some aspects of TDD :</p>

<ul>
<li>Kent Beck&rsquo;s classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080564&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tdd+by+example">TDD by example</a> remains a great reference for beginners</li>
<li>I got very useful advices from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Practical-Guide/dp/0131016490/ref=sr_1_3?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494911486&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=test+driven+practical+guide">TDD, a practical guide</a> especially the section about UI testing, which really saved me at some point</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080583&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests</a> is now a classic about what is called &ldquo;The London school of testing&rdquo;, which uses mocks as a design tool. Definitely a must read.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495080583&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/growing.jpg" alt="Cover of GOOSGT" /></a></p>

<h3>Practice advanced topics</h3>

<p>The TDD road goes on forever, testing has a lot of tricky topics. Once you&rsquo;ve mastered the basics, it&rsquo;s quite interesting to explore and practice more complex subjects. Here are a few things worth trying out :</p>

<ul>
<li>Use automated IDE refactorings to keep the code compiling all the way through a kata</li>
<li>Do the same kata twice, using <a href="/flavours-of-tdd/">top-down and bottom-up</a> styles</li>
<li>Do refactoring katas to learn how to work with legacy code</li>
<li>Do UI katas, to learn how to test the UI</li>
<li>Learn how to deal with DB</li>
<li>Learn how to handle remote services</li>
</ul>


<p>If needed, invent your own katas to deliberately practice these topics and others.</p>

<h2>The pitfalls</h2>

<p>As any road worth walking, the TDD path is not linear and smooth. Before fully mastering TDD, you&rsquo;ll regularly wonder if you&rsquo;re on the right track. As any practice, TDD has pitfalls. I&rsquo;ve fell into some quite a few times. I guess that&rsquo;s part of the learning process.</p>

<h3>Emerging Design</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s always been a lot of misunderstanding around this topic.</p>

<p>Bad smells in your code make your tests harder to write. If adding a test is painful, that&rsquo;s an indication that something could be improved in your design. It&rsquo;s then up to you to know what. Once you&rsquo;ve figured out what you want to change, use your existing tests to refactor your design first. Only then, add this new test.</p>

<p>As you can see, the tests will give you more feedback about the design of your code, but they won&rsquo;t tell you what to do. That&rsquo;s where your coding skills will help. This is particularly true about algorithms. Don&rsquo;t expect a good algorithm to magically appear as you do the simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work &hellip;</p>

<p>As with any rules, there are exceptions. At times, you&rsquo;ll walk into a problem which emerging design is great. For example, I&rsquo;ve done the <a href="http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/RomanNumerals-Kata">Arab to Romans</a> kata many times, and that repeatedly doing the simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work yields a good solution.</p>

<h3>Mocks</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">Mocks</a> are useful at times, but be careful not to overuse them. I already <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/mocking/">wrote about mocks</a>. Too much mocking makes your test suite brittle, ineffective and difficult to maintain ! I&rsquo;ve been bitten hard by this one on a personal <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses">side project</a>, the day I decided to get rid of all the mocks, I shrank the test code size by 25%. Since then I learned about alternate techniques such as :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test data builders</a> which allow to easily build test data</li>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value objects</a> that are immutable and don&rsquo;t need mocking</li>
<li><a href="/my-new-gem-for-creating-rspec-proxies/">test spies and proxies</a> as a way to mock and track calls while still calling the real code</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:4000/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">in-memory fake implementations</a> which make the tests independent and fast without unmaintainable proliferation of mock setup</li>
</ul>


<p>As an indicator, less than 5% of my tests use mocks.</p>

<h3>Metrics</h3>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M">keynote at RailsConf 2014</a> DHH explains the danger of testing metrics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-15-from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/dhh.jpg" alt="DHH's keynote at RailsConf 2014" /></a></p>

<p>By using TDD correctly, you should get a high code coverage as a side effect. If you get below 80%, you must be doing something wrong. The other metric you should keep an eye on is the total build time. Original <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> had the <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/ten_minute_build.html">10 minutes build rule</a> which states that if your build + tests takes more than 10 minutes, you should refactor it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it ! Things like 100% test coverage or test ratio are complete nonsense.</p>

<h2>Pushing it even further</h2>

<p>My promise, at the beginning of this post, was that Test Driven Development would make your life as a developer easier. Now let&rsquo;s imagine that your whole team or company was using TDD. It&rsquo;s a foundation on which to build a sustainable agile organization.</p>

<p>The mastery of automated testing at organization scale is a key element to continuous delivery, making releasing software a non-event, and as stress-free as possible.</p>

<p>Full adoption of TDD can yield to <a href="/incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/">incremental architecture</a> which delivers features faster, by skipping the conflictual arguments about supposed future needs.</p>

<p>Finally, TDD can simplify your processes and tooling. Team-wide TDD results in a steady flow of features on top of which it is easier to create simple and effective processes and tools.</p>

<p>The road is long, sinuous and at times rocky, but so are the rewards.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Being agile is about adapting to change and continuously improving. I&rsquo;ve seen (and been) in too many teams blindly following Scrum (<a href="/how-to-kill-scrum-zombies/">Scrum Zombies</a>) without figuring out how to continuous improve. The most obvious symptom is a boring (or no) retrospective.</p>

<p>Usually, it did not start that way, people had good intentions, and tried to follow the Scrum cookbook. Unfortunately, without any guidance or extreme perseverance, it is plain too easy to mess up the retrospective. If no concrete actions are scheduled at the end of the retro, if the same problems keep coming up at every retro, or if no problems at all are raised during the retro : your Scrum is somehow broken !</p>

<p>One of the promises of Scrum is to keep code quality high, in order to be able to adapt to late changes. Without a good retro to update the coding standards, the working agreements, or to spot and organize large scale refactoring, this will not happen.</p>

<p>One of the agile principle <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">explicitly states</a> the need for motivated team members. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494561757&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pink+drive">Drive</a> Daniel Pink explains that one of the ingredient for motivation is autonomy. As a way to fix recurring problems, effective retrospectives will create autonomy, and enable motivation. Dysfunctional retros will slowly kill both &hellip;</p>

<p>Although continuous improvement at all levels is one of the most important element in your process, it needs a bit of practice to setup right. After trying different approach in different teams, I compiled a list of the things that worked for me :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494561757&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pink+drive"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-09-most-scrum-teams-are-not-agile/drive.jpg" alt="The cover of the Daniel Pink's &quot;Drive&quot; book" /></a></p>

<h2>How to do successful retrospectives</h2>

<h3>Start !</h3>

<p>Sounds obvious ! The first step is to schedule a recurring meeting and invite all the team. Someone should take care of facilitating. If you want to improve things, do this yourself at the beginning ! Once the practice is in place and everyone sees the benefits, you&rsquo;ll be able to get some help.</p>

<p><a href="/how-we-introduced-efficient-agile-retrospectives/">Here</a> is a crash-course about how to organize and drive your first retrospective. If your team is distributed, you&rsquo;ll need a slightly different setup. In my previous team, we had success using <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a>, you can read more about it <a href="/trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-05-09-most-scrum-teams-are-not-agile/just-do-it.jpg" alt="Just Do It picture" /></p>

<h3>Make sure everyone talks</h3>

<p>Retros should not be &ldquo;just-another-boring-meeting&rdquo; ! People should be excited to be there and to solve their recurring problems. I&rsquo;ve seen retros where no one would speak, as if there was absolutely nothing to improve ! I&rsquo;ve also been in retros where people raised collaboration issues, and came up with drastic improvements to the way they work, like adopting pair-programming for example.</p>

<p>There can be many reason why people don&rsquo;t speak : habit, organizational culture &hellip; Whatever the cause, if you show them the path, if you demonstrate that retro work and that it is safe to speak, you&rsquo;ll get them to participate.</p>

<p>Here are a few tricks to guide a team there :</p>

<ul>
<li>It is said that if someone does not speak in the first 5 minutes of a meeting, he&rsquo;ll remain silent for the rest. That&rsquo;s why <a href="www.funretrospectives.com/category/energizer/">energizers</a> work. They force everyone to participate to a Fun activity right from the start. <a href="http://www.funretrospectives.com/">Fun Retrospective</a> contains a lot of engaging energizers.</li>
<li>Bring food ! Having food at work was one of Kent Beck&rsquo;s main advises in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416/ref=sr_1_2?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494561932&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=extreme+programming+explained+embrace+change">eXtreme Programming, Embrace Change</a>. Food is social and create a more relaxed and safer atmosphere.</li>
<li>Before you start the meeting, it might be useful to repeat the <a href="http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html">Retrospective&rsquo;s Prime Directive</a>.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>As the animator, you should make sure the discussions don&rsquo;t degenerate into some kind of trolling or blaming. If it&rsquo;s the case, remind that this is not the way the retro is meant to work. In worst case, give a 5 minutes break to everyone to calm down.</li>
<li>If needed, have a private discussion with people outside the retro to make sure that they understand the &ldquo;Blame the process, not the people&rdquo; principle of the retro well enough.</li>
</ul>


<p>Dealing with &ldquo;bad&rdquo; behavior in retros is a wide topic which I am only scratching the surface here. I guess I could write a full post about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.funretrospectives.com/"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-09-most-scrum-teams-are-not-agile/fun-retro.jpeg" alt="The cover of the &quot;Fun Retrospectives&quot; book" /></a></p>

<h3>Get out of with actionable tasks</h3>

<p>If you want a sure way to screw up your retros here it is : end the first one with no actionable things to do ! People will learn that it&rsquo;s a useless pscho-blabla meeting for agile softies.</p>

<p>This should be the absolute priority during the first retros. There are various kind of actionable tasks. Teams can adopt new conventions, decide to tackle some specific refactoring, or build a small new tool &hellip;</p>

<p>Actionable items should be small enough to be completed in one sprint. This is fine for refactoring a class, adding a <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> rule or asking for something from another team. What about larger tasks ? Suppose you just identified a large refactoring to do, how do you get started ? I know 2 strategies for that :</p>

<ul>
<li>Only identify the first step of what you want to start. At least, that&rsquo;s enough to get started and learn what to do later.</li>
<li>Agree on a <a href="https://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/">Mikado</a> discovery task to understand what needs to be done. Code is not the only thing that can be refactored with the Mikado method ! People have used it to transform <a href="http://nomad8.com/organisational-change-with-mikado/">organizations</a> !</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s also a good habit to book the rooms for extra time after the official retro time. Nothing is as frustrating as being interrupted while investigating a promising improvement !</p>

<p>Finally, I think it&rsquo;s a good practice to review what happened of the improvements that were selected during last retro. It stresses the importance of doing what was scheduled in retrospective. It also gives a chance to investigate the reason why they were not done !</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mikado-Method-Ola-Ellnestam/dp/1617291218/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494562230&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mikado+method"><img src="../imgs/2017-05-09-most-scrum-teams-are-not-agile/mikado-method.jpg" alt="The cover of the &quot;Mikado Method&quot; book" /></a></p>

<h3>Put them in the sprint</h3>

<p>When actions are selected in the retro, you should add them to the coming sprint before it starts. Obviously, you&rsquo;ll add non business related items in your sprint backlog. Whatever you might have hear from agile zealots, do it ! Process improvements are fist class backlog citizens, just don&rsquo;t discuss them with your <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/who-professional-scrum-product-owner">product owner</a>.</p>

<p>If you want a chance to deliver what you committed to in your sprint backlog, you&rsquo;ll need bandwidth for that ! They are many ways to do get that. Some teams use <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">slack time</a>, others reserve an &lsquo;improvement day&rsquo; every sprint. My personal favorite (and the one we&rsquo;ve been doing at work) is to estimate the improvements in story points and reserve a fraction (ex 20%) of your story points for improvements.</p>

<p>You can try to negotiate your improvement ratio with your product owner &hellip; or you might also just set it yourself ! The team is responsible for the quality of its work. Better be sorry than ineffective. If you stick to your ratio and only work on the most important improvements, it&rsquo;s usually pretty easy to justify working on them. Plus if you manage to go under the radar for a few sprints, the results of the improvements should speak by themselves.</p>

<h3>Do them as soon as the sprint starts</h3>

<p>One last thing. Start to work on your improvements as soon as the sprint starts.</p>

<p>Improvements are similar to investments : you invest in process, tools or code in exchange for more value creation downstream. Once you&rsquo;ve decided to invest in something, what&rsquo;s the point of waiting 1 week ? Plus if you wait for later in the sprint, you run the risk of having unfinished improvements at the next retro, which might interfere when prioritizing new ones.</p>

<h2>Continuously improving teams</h2>

<p>Being part of a continuously improving team is easier to live than to describe. It feels like the future is bright. Once a team has mastered continuous improvement, people can be optimistic that they&rsquo;ll manage to adapt to change later down the road :</p>

<ul>
<li>They could switch gears and go full speed on a particular re-architecture</li>
<li>They could change their working agreements to adapt to new constraints</li>
<li>They could re-focus their efforts to handle a maintenance pike</li>
</ul>


<p>At the end of the day, bottom-up continuous improvement makes everyone&rsquo;s lives easier. Developers experience more autonomy while improving their productivity, they can do good work (which also means spending less time bug-fixing). Product owners learn that they can trust the team to do their best. Sponsors get more value for their money.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How come the &ldquo;agile scaling&rdquo; landscape seems so daunting and bloated ?</p>

<p>Being agile should be about taking baby steps, doing things incrementally, starting with the simplest thing that could possibly work, slowly but continuously improving and trying out experiments.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a real-life 2 hours change that kicks-off a very efficient organization for a few scrum teams.</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/2017-05-02-a-straightforward-way-to-scale-to-more-than-1-scrum-team/dive-jump.jpg" alt="A guy jumping from a cliff into the sea" /><div class="image-credits">&ldquo;SafeLess&rdquo; : everything will go fine as long as you follow the principles</div></p>

<h2>A classic story</h2>

<p>Without doing anything about it, there are a lot of situations in where <a href="https://www.scrum.org/">Scrum</a> teams will collaborate inefficiently. For example if you are a developer within a medium or large company, suffering from communication loss between your team and others. Or you could be the owner of a software startup, needing to dramatically grow your dev team.</p>

<p>Whatever your situation, without good collaboration, the output of two Scrum teams is bound to be a fraction of the sum of their individual outputs.</p>

<h3>Our own situation</h3>

<p>We are a group of 4 teams that spun out of the R&amp;D division. We are working to build a highly reusable component for the future versions of <a href="http://www.murex.com">Murex</a>&rsquo;s main product.</p>

<p>While in R&amp;D, teams were aligned with technologies. Now shifting to a product focus, this layered team structure makes it hard for us to organize efficiently. To make things even more tricky, the component we are building is something huge by itself, and we really need to find a way to deliver it incrementally.</p>

<p>This tech-oriented, low synchronization organization of team backlog was really underdelivering. It was not rare to see stories jump from one team to another, as dependencies were discovered, taking one full sprint every time. Integrating end to end features often took a few sprints instead of a few hours &hellip;</p>

<p>Clearly, we needed to do something.</p>

<h3>The simplest things that could possibly work</h3>

<p>Hopefully, all teams were following Scrum. We first had a look at scaling frameworks, especially since other parts of the company are moving to <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> but we found that they required too much budget and re-organization for our means (remember, we are just a few motivated developers).</p>

<p>While we were discussing what to do, someone had an idea that was simple, cheap and easy : &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start by doing all our scrum ceremonies together&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We took the opportunity to add a &lsquo;product&rsquo; retro after the teams retros, and a &lsquo;product&rsquo; planning just before the teams plannings. We were hoping that regular higher level retros would bring continuous improvement at the product scale and bring in all the other practices required to make it work.</p>

<h3>The situation now</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s now been 2 sprints that we have set this up. Every 2 weeks, Friday is what we call Demo-Day. It&rsquo;s a meeting heavy day where all the teams have their scrum ceremonies together</p>

<ul>
<li>Product demo</li>
<li>Team retros</li>
<li>Product retro</li>
<li>Product planning</li>
<li>Team planning</li>
</ul>


<p>Sure as hell, 1 day of meetings is exhausting, but unfortunately, it is not possible to efficiently grow a team without increasing the communication overhead. The good side of the coin is that it allows the teams to focus on building valuable stuff during the 9 other days.</p>

<p>Here are the first effects we have seen.</p>

<h4>Improved team spirit &amp; product focus</h4>

<p>The first noticeable effect was on team spirit. Having a demo and planning for the whole team showed to everyone that we are all pulling towards the same goal. It helped everyone to understand what his current role is in this greater scheme, but also ways to tweak our individual roles to bring more value.</p>

<h4>Visible problems</h4>

<p>The second good effect is that problems are now visible. If teams are not working in the same direction, it&rsquo;s visible at the demo and plannings. If a team delivers a story too late for another one to integrated it, it&rsquo;s again visible at demo and planning.</p>

<p>Another example : after the product planning, Product Managers had to admit that they had not managed to feed high value stories to all teams. They asked to do a pre-planning preparation meeting (which is a standard practice in <a href="https://less.works">LeSS</a> for example)</p>

<h4>Better continuous improvement</h4>

<p>During our first team retro in this setting, we directly stumbled upon on a recurring systemic issue that we never managed to do anything about. Instead of going around in circle on the topic again, we pushed it to the product retro. We worked on another team related problem, for which we scheduled improvement actions.</p>

<p>During the product retro, we raised our recurring unsolved issue. With everyone in place, people higher in the organization had the chance to understand its consequences. Eventually, we managed to come up with concrete actions.</p>

<h2>How to do it</h2>

<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s only one thing required : that the teams are already following Scrum. All the rest is easy stuff.</p>

<p>This technique is a bottom-up agile adoption. If you want to switch your whole company from waterfall to something more agile, take a look at <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>.</p>

<h3>Organizing the Demo-Day</h3>

<p>Here is our planning for our demo day</p>

<p>We had to negotiate a bit with other people in the company to get enough rooms for all these meetings at the same time, but all in all, it did not take more than 2 hours.</p>

<p>All meetings are open to anyone, everyone should have the right to come to any of them !</p>

<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s a long day ! It&rsquo;s also full of team energy. In 2 sprints, we found the following improvements :</p>

<h4>Food</h4>

<p>We pre-order food to be delivered at work, so that we can all eat together. Did you know that food makes retros more efficient ?</p>

<h4>Product Retro</h4>

<p>You might have noticed that the product retro is only 1 hour long. To make it all fit in one day, we had to cut some time here and there &hellip; In order to gain some time on the product retro, we decided to pre-fill its &lsquo;gather data&rsquo; phase.</p>

<p>During team retros, if people find product scale issues, they can directly save them for the product retro items (As we are distributed, we use <a href="/trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/">Trello for retrospectives</a>). This way, when the product retro starts, the gather data phase is almost done, pre-filled with genuine points.</p>

<h4>Keep the energy high</h4>

<p>One full day of meetings is long. People get tired. In order to keep the energy high and the overall experience fun, we deliberately added some fun throughout the day :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.funretrospectives.com/category/energizer/">Energizers</a> at beginning of meetings</li>
<li>Board games during breaks</li>
<li>End of day celebration outside the office. You could go out and have a drink all together for exemple.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparing the product Backlog</h3>

<p>Depending on your situation, you might (or not) have a prioritized product backlog. My advice is to start with what you have.</p>

<p>If you are scaling your single team to 2, keep a unique backlog for both teams and create 2 feature teams. You&rsquo;ll be heading to the <a href="https://less.works">LeSS</a> organization, which you&rsquo;ll be able to refer to.</p>

<p>If you are applying this on existing scrum teams with their own backlogs, it might be easier to create a product backlog for the product managers. This is more akin to what <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> suggests. It&rsquo;s not as straightforward as having a single backlog for everyone, you&rsquo;ll need to add some links between team and product stories to be able to track progress. Nevertheless, it provides visibility to everyone. As a side note, this is what we actually did.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that it&rsquo;s only a starting point anyway, product retrospectives might transform all this down the road any way.</p>

<h3>Start where you are now !</h3>

<p>The most important thing to do is to start ! There are always a ton of reasons why things are not ready and need more preparation. Remember the agile principles : integrate early and often, adapt, experiment &hellip; Here are few examples of bad reasons  not to start</p>

<ul>
<li>You cannot get all the good people in the room : start, invite them anyway, and send them a report of what has been decided without them. I cannot promise that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s going to work at the end, but at least, it will create some discussions</li>
<li>The product backlog is not ready : start, and see what happens ! It will make it clear to everyone that product backlog is super important. People will organize to provide enough product features next sprint.</li>
<li>You need some other regular meetings for X, Y or Z. For example, <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum-of-scrums/">Scrum of Scrum</a> has daily SoS Meetings. Start anyway, if there&rsquo;s a need, people will ask for these extra meetings, which will save you some goodwill. You might also discover that you don&rsquo;t need these meetings at all and save some time !</li>
</ul>


<p>With a product retrospective every sprint, important issues will get addressed !</p>

<h2>Does &lsquo;Agile Scaling&rsquo; even exist ?</h2>

<p>We did this on 4 teams. I have no ideas how it would work with more teams. We did not use any framework, even though we took ideas here and there. What we really did is to follow the agile principles, for example :</p>

<ul>
<li>KISS</li>
<li>Do the simplest thing that could work</li>
<li>Baby steps</li>
<li>Continuous improvement</li>
<li>Experiment</li>
</ul>


<p>Others have noticed similar things :</p>

<ul>
<li>LeSS : <a href="https://less.works/less/framework/introduction.html">&ldquo;Truly scaled scrum is Scrum scaled.&rdquo;</a></li>
<li>In the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Software-Development-Simple-Valuable/dp/1941222374/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493870372&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+nature+of+software+development">Nature of Software</a> <a href="http://ronjeffries.com/">Ron Jeffries</a> explains that for a company is agile if it just focuses on delivering software &ldquo;feature by feature&rdquo;</li>
<li>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Approach-Large-Scale-Agile-Development/dp/0321821726/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493870423&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=large+scale+hp">A Practical Approach to Large-Scale Agile Development [&hellip;]</a>, the authors explain that they did not use any frameworks at HP, but just followed the agile principles</li>
</ul>


<p>Agile scaling frameworks might be a good starting point (the Shu in <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari">Shu-Ha-Ri</a>), but only as long as the agile principles and values have not been understood by the organization.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in 2001, when I started to code for a living, fresh out of school, I was mainly doing a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding">cowboy coding</a>. After a few months of maintaining my own mess, I started to recall my university lessons : we should be doing design before coding &hellip;</p>

<p>When I was asked to re-engineer the &lsquo;wizards UI&rsquo;, I paused my coding to design something clean from scratch. It worked quite well at first : the overall code was a lot simpler and contained a lot less duplication than before. Seeing this new shiny UI, product people asked for new features. Unfortunately, I hadn&rsquo;t thought of them when designing this little framework. I was almost back at my initial situation.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how I started to look for another way to design software. At about the same time the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416/ref=sr_1_3?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493096057&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=extreme+programming">eXtreme Programming book</a> fell into my hands. That&rsquo;s where I discovered the idea of incremental design and architecture.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416/ref=sr_1_3?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493096057&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=extreme+programming"><img src="../imgs/2017-04-24-incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/xp-1ed.jpg" alt="Front cover of the first edition of the XP book" /></a></p>

<h2>What is Incremental Archi</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the antithesis of incremental architecture :</p>

<h3>Astronaut Architecture</h3>

<p>The term &ldquo;Architecture Astronaut&rdquo; was coined by <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky</a> back in 2001. If you haven&rsquo;t read this <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/">classic post</a> yet, I strongly encourage you to do so. Basically, he explains that we should not be impressed by architects going over their heads talking about too abstract stuff.</p>

<p>Incremental is the exact opposite of astronaut architecture</p>

<h3>Two Schools to Software Architecture</h3>

<p>Traditional architecture is about taking up-front choices that will be difficult to change. Incremental architecture is about preparing for non-stop change and taking decisions as late as possible.</p>

<p>The idea in incremental architecture is really simple : keep your code simple, clean and automatically tested in order to be able to simply adapt your code and architecture when definitely needed.</p>

<h3>Pros and Cons of incremental architecture</h3>

<p>The first reaction of most software engineers (me included, remember how my story started) is that it can only work on trivial stuff. After practicing it for about a decade, I am now convinced it works most of the time. I&rsquo;m not alone, <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/incremental_design.html">James Shore</a> (who wrote the more on the subject) also shares my view:</p>

<blockquote><p>Common thought is that distributed processing, persistence, internationalization, security, and transaction structure are so complex that you must consider them from the start of your project. I disagree; I&rsquo;ve dealt with all of them incrementally.</p>

<p>Two issues that remain difficult to change are choice of programming language and platform. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to make those decisions incrementally!</p></blockquote>

<p>I would add published APIs to this list.</p>

<p>Granted, there are situations that incremental architecture alone cannot handle, what about its good points then ?</p>

<p>In all the other cases (and that means most of the time), here is what you get :</p>

<ul>
<li>As you won&rsquo;t need to deal with future use cases, you&rsquo;ll do less work</li>
<li>That in turn, will keep your code simpler, decreasing time to release new features</li>
<li>As change is built-in, you&rsquo;ll be able to improve your architecture in ways you could not have imagined from the start !</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-Pragmatic-Software/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493096137&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile+development"><img src="../imgs/2017-04-24-incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/art-of-agile.jpg" alt="Front cover of the Art of Agile Software Development book" /></a></p>

<p>If you cannot see how this could possibly work ? Read on !</p>

<h2>How to do it</h2>

<h3>eXtreme Programming</h3>

<p>As I said earlier, incremental architecture emerged from eXtreme Programming. It won&rsquo;t come as a surprise that in order to work well incremental architecture requires the XP practices to be in place. In particular, the code base should be automatically tested, the continuous integration cycle should take less than 10 minutes, the design should be simple. The team should be good at doing refactoring.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect to be able to do incremental architecture without these practices in place. But this alone might be enough already !</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493096197&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fowler+refactoring"><img src="../imgs/2017-04-24-incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/refactoring.jpg" alt="Front cover of the Martin Fowler's refactoring book" /></a></p>

<h3>Architecture Vision</h3>

<p>At work, where our team consists of 9 developers, it&rsquo;s not always that simple to coordinate and all pull in the same direction. That&rsquo;s why we find it useful to share a very long term architecture vision (<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/enabling-incremental-design-and-evolutionary-architecture">Enabling Incremental Design and Evolutionary Architecture</a>). This will help people to make coherent decisions when hesitating between 2 alternate designs.</p>

<p>The vision can be the result of the work of a pair, or a mob brainstorming or whatever. Building this vision is typically an activity where experienced programmers can contribute a lot of value.</p>

<p>Once this vision is shared and understood by the team, every time a pair has to work on a story, they can orient the design towards it. But always as little as possible to finish the work at hand, remember the XP motos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS (Keep It Simple &amp; Stupid)</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI (You Ain&rsquo;t Gonna Need It</a>.</p>

<p>One final word &hellip; a vision is just that : a vision ! It might turn out true, or false, be ready to change it as circumstances change.</p>

<h3>Spikes</h3>

<p>At times, even with a story in your hands and a long term architecture sketch on the whiteboard, you might have difficulties to know how to change your design to fulfill both.</p>

<p>As always in XP, in case of uncertainty, use <a href="http://agiledictionary.com/209/spike/">Spikes</a> ! Spikes are short time-boxed experiments of throwaway code, which goal is to answer a specific design question.</p>

<h3>How to mitigate the risks</h3>

<p>What about these topics that don&rsquo;t yield to incremental architecture ? What if you discover late that you need to change your platform ? Or your API ?</p>

<p>Obviously, you should think about these questions up-front. Hopefully, there are usually not that difficult to answer. But, over time, Non-Functional-Requirements and technologies change. Large and long living systems are particularly likely to need to change to a new platform someday.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix had the answer</a> : build your system out of small tools, that do only one thing well, and that communicate through a standard protocol. Systems built that way can be re-written one piece at a time.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"><img src="../imgs/2017-04-24-incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/Ken_n_dennis.jpg" alt="Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, the creators of Unix" /></a><div class="image-credits">Photo from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ken_n_dennis.jpg">WikiMedia</a></div></p>

<p>The modern version of this is the micro-services architecture. Incremental architecture allows you to start with a monolith, split it when you need to, and replace micro-services as needed.   With the safety of simple code and a great automated test harness. Interestingly, successful software systems that were architectured up-front also take this road &hellip; without the safety !</p>

<h3>The Architect</h3>

<p>Good news : no more PowerPoints and a lot more coding with the team ! Here is what&rsquo;s expected from an incremental architect :</p>

<ul>
<li>To code with the team. As Bertrand Meyer once said &ldquo;<a href="http://stal.blogspot.fr/2008/08/architect-always-implements.html">Bubbles (aka. diagrams) don&rsquo;t crash</a>&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s plain too easy, and wrong, to mandate architecture without living with the consequences</li>
<li>To come up with more ideas when drafting the long term vision</li>
<li>To keep an eye on the &lsquo;long term&rsquo; while being the navigator in pair programming</li>
<li>In the second edition of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493096057&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=extreme+programming">XP book</a> Kent Beck suggests that the architect should write large scale tests to stress the system and demonstrate architecture issues to the team</li>
<li>To delegate as much as possible to the team. However smart the architect, the team as a whole is smarter ! Delegating architecture increases motivation and the quality of the outcome.</li>
</ul>


<h2>End of the story</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been practicing incremental architecture and design for a long time now. It made my life a lot simpler ! Most architecture questions become backlog items to prioritize.</p>

<p>One last advice : be prepared to re-read <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/">Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s article</a> whenever you get caught up in architecture meetings &hellip;</p>
