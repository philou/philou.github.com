  <div class="entry-content"><p>Current software project tracking tools suck !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-12-14-my-dream-lean-software-development-tool-lean-software-development-part-9/it-sucks.jpg" title="A stamp that writes &#34;SUCKS&#34;" alt="A stamp that writes &#34;SUCKS&#34;"></p>

<p>By writing <a href="/the-flow-book-summary-lean-software-development_part_1/">this series of posts</a>, I realized that they should help us to prioritize rather than just serving as a nice GUIs on top of a ticket database.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take the story of developer Joe as an example. Joe is working for Megacorp, where he makes a good living, but feels like a small cog in the machine. He has lost the thrill of programming &hellip; He&rsquo;s still staying informed about latest trends in software world, but his job involves aging technologies. He knows that if he wants to remain in the course, he has to change gears. One day, he decides to do something <em>now</em>, and starts a side project in the hope of someday making a living out of it.</p>

<p>He does not have a large amount of money to invest in his project, so he decides to bootstrap his product using <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a>. He reads and understands that there is a lot of different kind of activities to do if he wants to realize his dream : experiments, marketing, sales, design, coding &hellip;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he&rsquo;s so tired of programming boring stuff that he contracted the developer bias : he starves to code cool things again ! He knows the rest is important, he tries to do some of it, but he just doesn&rsquo;t realize how <em>much</em> needs to be done. So, without realising it, he wastes a lot of time coding something that people eventually don&rsquo;t buy. After 1 or 2 years of hard work, a working product but no users, he eventually quits, quite depressed &hellip;</p>

<p>I guess you don&rsquo;t want to be Joe ! I know you&rsquo;ll think it won&rsquo;t happen to you &hellip; believe me, it can, <a href="rip-mes-courses-dot-fr/">I learned it the hard way</a> !</p>

<p>Now suppose you had a tool that estimates the expected values of all different tasks :</p>

<ul>
<li>By applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo simulations</a> to probabilistic value and size ranges, it could compute which features we should work on first. As a side effect, this could give us some release date estimates for a feature, depending on its position in the backlog.</li>
<li>By having explicit experiment tasks with target value or size ranges, it could compute the value of information and prioritize experiments versus other tasks.</li>
<li>Crossing informations from IDEs, VCS, Quality Trackers and CIs, it could detect technical debt items (aka. productivity opportunities), compute their values in the long run, and prioritize them with other tasks.</li>
<li>If we found a way to integrate marketing, sales and design tasks, any kind of activity could be stored in the backlog, valued and prioritized.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is what the backlog could look like :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-12-14-my-dream-lean-software-development-tool-lean-software-development-part-9/mockup.jpg" title="A mockup of the backlog view of such a product" ></p>

<p>All different kind of activities (developments, marketing, experiments, refactorings) would fit in the backlog. The system would estimate the value of every task for Joe, advising him what to work on first. It would make it obvious just how much market experiments are important when starting ! With such a tool, he is a lot more likely to build his new life.</p>

<p>The good thing with such a tool is that it could be built by feeding itself. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">Eating its own dog&rsquo;s food</a> has always been the nice thing about writing software tools.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to know, what do you think of the idea ? Would you use such a tool ? Is it worth me spending my nights building it ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There must be a way to know the real money value of <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-12-07-how-ill-measure-the-lean-startup-value-of-information-in-my-next-side-project-lean-software-development-part-8/knowledge-money.jpg" title="A brain or some money ?" ></p>

<p>Lean Startup is about gathering &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; through experiments instead of building things. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009/ref=sr_1_3?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450068976&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=lean+product+development">Flow book</a> suggests that the value of an information is its expected impact on the bottom line. So by combining both, there should be a way to compute a quantitative value for the knowledge.</p>

<p>The overall plan would be :</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a rough business plan, but assume that all that&rsquo;s in it has got 1 chance out of 10 of being right</li>
<li>Design experiments to precise the likelyhood of what&rsquo;s in the business plan</li>
<li>Compute the value of each experiment as the difference of the expected bottom line after and before running it (This should be possible if relying on the business plan for other parameters)</li>
<li>Work on the task with the highest expected value, be it an experiment, a development, a sales task, or whatever</li>
<li>Adapt you business plan with any new information</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
<li>If it becomes obvious that the expected final earnings are too low, pivot</li>
</ol>


<p>Flow explains that all the principles are pretty robust to bad inputs and errors. In short, the final estimations of earnings are still a lot better than without using any specific method. In the case of Lean Startup, it means that a false business plan is a good enough starting point.</p>

<h2>How to assess the likelyhood of a figure ?</h2>

<p>By default let&rsquo;s assume the value of a feature is somewhere between 0 and your highest estimate. As we&rsquo;ll go through experiments we&rsquo;ll be able to narrow this value range and have a more accurate estimate for the real value.</p>

<p>To keep things simple we could assume that the probability of value is uniformaly distributed within this range. From what I read in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449901015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=waltzing+with+bears">Waltzing With Bears</a>, here would be a more realistic probability distribution.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-12-07-how-ill-measure-the-lean-startup-value-of-information-in-my-next-side-project-lean-software-development-part-8/Demarco-probability.png" title="The curve of the probability of value according to DeMarco" ></p>

<h2>How to estimate the value of an experiment ?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into the details here, because the logic is exactly the same as with technical experiments (which <a href="/measure-the-business-value-of-your-spikes-and-take-high-payoff-risks-lean-software-development-part-4/">I already wrote about</a>)</p>

<p>Since then though, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449901015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=waltzing+with+bears">Waltzing With Bears</a> which presents a way of doing Monte Carlo simulations in order to estimate risks on your project. I guess the same thing could be used for value, which would save us from a lot of complex math.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449901015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=waltzing+with+bears"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-12-07-how-ill-measure-the-lean-startup-value-of-information-in-my-next-side-project-lean-software-development-part-8/waltzing-with-bears.jpg" title="Cover of 'Waltzing With Bears'" ></a></p>

<h2>When to stop doing experiments ?</h2>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t all this overkill ? One could argue that the point of Lean Startup should be to build just enough knowledge ! In fact, this value of information concept naturaly helps to find out when running the experiment is not worth it compared to actually doing the real thing.</p>

<p>BTW, a tool doing all this for your automaticaly would be great, wouldn&rsquo;t it ?</p>

<h2>What I&rsquo;ll do for my next bootstrap side project</h2>

<ol>
<li>Start with a target hourly earning rate.</li>
<li>Collect a list of projects I&rsquo;d be interested in.</li>
<li>Pick a project and write a business goal for it.</li>
<li>Assign likelyhoods and ranges on every figure in the business plan.</li>
<li>Design experiments to improve the figures.</li>
<li>Create tasks to actually build and sell the product.</li>
<li>Compute values for each of these tasks.</li>
<li>Work the most valueable first.</li>
<li>If the figures prove that I will not make my target wage with this project, I&rsquo;ll pivot, and restart from 2.</li>
<li>Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll repeat from 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> together to handle my various development environments. It usually works just fine : it&rsquo;s fast, low weight, it keeps my machine clean and it&rsquo;s quite simple once you&rsquo;ve setup your first VM. Until last time &hellip; read on !</p>

<p>When I tried to start my docker session through Vagrant as usuall, here is the error I suddenly got :</p>

<p>After a bit of Google searching, I found that the docker service needed to be started. <code>service docker start</code> did the trick &hellip; until next reboot !</p>

<p>With still some more Googling, I found a <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/19320/how-to-enable-or-disable-services">page</a> explaining how to manage Ubuntu services. In order to make the docker service automaticaly start at every reboot, I just had to enter the following :</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>systemctl enable docker.service</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That did the trick ! I thought that might be useful for others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Madoff would have been better off managing software projects than investing on Wall Street !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-10-01-the-technical-debt-ponzi-scheme/bernie.jpg" title="&#34;Madoff's photo in jail&#34;" alt="&#34;Madoff's photo in jail&#34;"></p>

<p>Whereas in finance, a Ponzi scheme is a sure road to jail, it seems to be the de-facto standard in software development.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Software-Debt-Inevitable-Development/dp/0321554132/ref=sr_1_2?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443728175&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=managing+technical+debt">Managing Software Debt</a>, hoping to find methods about how to manage technical debt with some hard numbers (instead I found some good practices to avoid it, but that&rsquo;s another story). At no place did I read that taking more debt to pay the interests of existing debt was a good practice though &hellip;</p>

<p>Thinking of it, I can remember of such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi Schemes</a> in nearly every organization I worked in. Here are a few typical manifestations I saw :</p>

<ul>
<li>writing bogus code to compensate for some other bogus code</li>
<li>creating tools to workaround existing technical debt. Ex:

<ul>
<li>exotic build tools to build some code riddled with cyclic dependencies that no sane build tool can build</li>
<li>in house tools that do 10% of what standard (open source) tools can do on code following main standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>If this goes on for too long, you can end up in a technical debt death spiral : you know debt is out of control, so taking debt becomes the only way of actually getting anything done. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s win this client now, because we won&rsquo;t be able to later &hellip;&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s like running to one&rsquo;s own ruin.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-10-01-the-technical-debt-ponzi-scheme/road-wall.jpg" title="&#34;A road going straight in a wall&#34;" alt="&#34;A road going straight in a wall&#34;"></p>

<p>If your organization is in this stage, you might think at the <a href="/a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/">&lsquo;time horizon&rsquo;</a> of your product, and discover that fixing the technical debt sometimes brings more value than getting this new client !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just invented the word, I found it funny :</p>

<blockquote><p>Silosis: an internal organization of an enterprise in which people are grouped by job titles. Although not obvious at first sight, it usually involves excessively high communication costs. Worst cases can create vicious circles where more &lsquo;communication people&rsquo; are added which in turn increase the overall communication costs &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Here are other reasons I don&rsquo;t like silos :</p>

<ul>
<li>Silos create local optimums, which <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/B00CAYOX3O/ref=sr_1_sc_2?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441546057&amp;sr=8-2-spell&amp;keywords=reinsertsen+flow">lean theory</a> (and mathematics) taught us is bad</li>
<li>Silos create specialists, which bring the whole system to a halt when they leave</li>
<li>Silos create work queue, which increase cycle time</li>
<li>Silos create some form of black market in the organization, through which people can bypass the official communication channel and actually get the job done</li>
<li>Silos hides the big picture to anyone, thus removing autonomy from and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441546115&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=daniel+pink+drive">demotivating people</a></li>

<h2>Our Experience</h2>

<p>We just gave it a try. As a fist experiment, we did it at just 3, all willing to try. Here is the ROTI (Return On Time Invested)</p>

<h2>If you want to try it</h2>

<p>A few last minute advises  :</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t force it onto people, start with volunteers</li>
<li>There must be a safe and positive atmosphere in the team</li>
<li>This is an improvement exercices, and it should not be used as any kind of evaluation</li>
<li>Learn how to give feedback

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.murex.com">Our company</a> provides trainings on non violent communication and positive feedback, maybe yours does too !</li>
<li>Appelo explains how to give written feedback in his other book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9492032023">#Workout</a>. Though better suited for email feedback, I found it a great way to prepare for the session.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The sad truth :</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> metaphor does not help me to fix it.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-08-20-a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/debt.jpg" title="&#34;A desperate man counting his debts&#34;" alt="&#34;A desperate man counting his debts&#34;"></p>

<p>Here is my modest 2€ plan about how to try to get out of this.</p>

<h2>Why does the metaphor fall short ?</h2>

<p>The debt comparison effectively helps non programming people to understand that bad code costs money. Unfortunately, it does not tell you how much. As a consequence, deciding whether it&rsquo;s best to fix the technical debt or to live with it remains a gut feeling decision <del>(aka programmers want to stop the world and fix all of it while the product owner wants to live with it)</del>.</p>

<p>They are very good reason why we cannot measure how much the technical debt costs :</p>

<ul>
<li>It is purely subjective : bad code for someone might be good code for another. Even worse, as you become a better programmer, yesterday&rsquo;s master piece might become today&rsquo;s crap. More often, as a team gains insight on the domain, old code might suddenly appear completely wrong &hellip;</li>
<li>Tools such as Sonar only spot the a small part of the debt. The larger part (design, architecture and domain) remains invisible</li>
<li>Finally, non-remediation cost (the time wasted working on the bad code) is often overlooked and very difficult to measure : it depends on what you are going to work in the future !</li>
</ul>


<p>No surprise it&rsquo;s difficult to convince anyone else why fixing your debt is a good investment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dilbert.com"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-08-20-a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/dilbert.jpg" title="&#34;A dilbert cartoon about a programmer killed by technical debt&#34;" alt="&#34;A dilbert cartoon about a programmer killed by technical debt&#34;"></a></p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>In the team, we usually try not to create debt in the first place. We have strong code conventions and working agreements. We are doing a lot of refactoring in order to keep our code base clean. But even with all this, debt creeps in :</p>

<ul>
<li>a pair worked on something and did not know that there is another part of the system that does roughly the same thing</li>
<li>we understand something new about the domain and some previously fine code becomes debt !</li>
<li>like all programmers, we are constantly in a hurry, and sometimes, we just let debt through</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>If the required refactoring is small enough, we just slip it inside a user story and do it on the fly. The real problem comes larger refactorings.</p>

<p>The strategy to deal with those is to get estimations of both the remediation and non-remediation costs. This way, the technical debt becomes an investment ! Invest X$ now and receive Y$ every month up to the end of the life of product. Provided you have the Cost Of Delay of the product, you can estimate the cost of delay of this individual technical debt fix. For example :</p>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s define the product horizon as its expected remaining life span at any moment</li>
<li>Suppose the product has a 5 years (60 months) horizon</li>
<li>Suppose the Cost Of Delay of the full product is 150K€/month</li>
<li>Suppose that the technical debt costs 10 days (0.5 month) to fix</li>
<li>Suppose that that once fixed, you&rsquo;ll save 2 days (0.1 month) of work per month</li>
<li>By doing the fix now, at the end of the 5 years, you would have saved : <em>(60 &ndash; 0.5) * 0.1 &ndash; 0.5 = 5.45 months</em></li>
<li>Using CoD, this ammounts to : <em>5.45 * 159K = 817.5K €</em></li>
<li>Dividing by the number of months, we finaly get the CoD for this technical debt fix : <em>817.5K / 60 = 13 625 €/month</em></li>
</ul>


<p>This can be compared to the CoD of other backlog items, allowing us to prioritize large refactorings as we would of any feature or story.</p>

<p>One nice thing about this is that it not only helps to know if a refactoring is cost effective, but also when is the best moment to do it. As the CoD of the refactoring is proportional to inverse of the product horizon, a premature refactoring for a startup product might become a real bargain after the product has settled as a market leader. Here are examples of possible product horizons :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Context </th>
<th> Horizon</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Startup </td>
<td> 6 months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 years old company </td>
<td> 3 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Market leading product </td>
<td> 10 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aging System </td>
<td> 5 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Legacy System </td>
<td> 2 years</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br/>


<p>Oh, and just one more thing &hellip; prioritizing technical debt fixes in your backlog will create some real time to focus on and only on refactoring, reducing task switching and saving even more time.</p>

<p>All this sounds great ! There&rsquo;s just one last little thing : how do we get estimations of both costs of the technical debt ?</p>

<h2>Idea 1 : Collective Estimations</h2>

<p>When I attended Donald Reinertsen&rsquo;s training, I asked him the question and he answered :</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;d gather the top programmers in a room and I&rsquo;d make them do an estimation of both costs.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I asked my team if they wanted to do the following :</p>

<ol>
<li>whenever you spot a large piece of debt, create a JIRA issue for it</li>
<li>at the end of your next sprint planning session, go through all your technical debt issues, and for each

<ol>
<li>estimate the remediation cost in story points</li>
<li>estimate the non-remediation cost on the coming sprint, taking the prioritized stories into account</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>using the ROI horizon for every issues, collectively decide which one to tackle and add them to the sprint backlog</li>
</ol>


<p>To keep the story short, it did not stick. I bet it was just too boring.</p>

<h2>Idea 2 : Technical Debt Code Annotations</h2>

<p>During a retrospective, we discussed marking technical debt directly in the code to decide when to fix it. I created 2 code annotations so that this can be done. Here is an example of some identified technical debt :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>       <span class="s">&quot;For union, we lost quite some time identifying which transformers were not copying the full tree&quot;</span><span class="o">)})</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="n">AstNode</span> <span class="nf">analyzeAst</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">AstNode</span> <span class="n">ast</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The @TechnicalDebt annotation identifies areas of the code that could be improved.
The @Waste annotation is a way to log time wasted because of this bad code.</p>

<p>By comparing the time to fix the technical debt and the flow of extra work it incurs, we should be able to more easily justify and prioritize these in our backlog.</p>

<p>We are thinking of writing a sonar plugin to keep track of this technical debt right in our <a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">Sonar dashboard</a>. It would :</p>

<ul>
<li>create a technical debt item in sonar for every @TechnicalDebt annotation found in the code</li>
<li>link it with a mirror technical debt issue in JIRA</li>
<li>use the story points we entered in the annotation as remediation cost</li>
<li>extrapolate the non remediation cost by the sum of wasted hours registered during the last month</li>
</ul>


<p>We just started using those, and I cannot give enough feedback for the moment. I bet not enough @Waste items will be entered though &hellip; again, it might just be too boring</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-08-20-a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/sonar-sqale.jpg" title="&#34;A screenshot of Sonar Qube Sqale technical debt plugin&#34;" alt="&#34;A screenshot of Sonar Qube Sqale technical debt plugin&#34;"></a></p>

<h2>Idea 3 : Sonar and IDE Plugins</h2>

<p>If it&rsquo;s too boring to add @Waste annotations in the code, it might be easier to have an IDE plugin with 1 big button to register some time wasted on the local @TechnicalDebt zone.</p>

<p>Pushing things a bit further, it might even be possible to estimate non remediation cost by having a look at what files are read the more, what files are triggering the more test failures when changed, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s a long shot, we&rsquo;re definitely not there yet !</p>

<h2>Possible Improvements</h2>

<h3>The Mikado Method</h3>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;ve got these estimations or not, it&rsquo;s always a good practice to learn how to  use the <a href="https://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/the-mikado-method-in-under-a-minute/">mikado method</a>. It&rsquo;s great to split a refactoring into smaller part and spread them over many sprints.</p>

<p>The pill is easier to swallow for everyone, and it keeps the code releasable at any given time.</p>

<h3>Decision Rule</h3>

<p>Provided you have :</p>

<ul>
<li>Product CoD</li>
<li>Top Features CoD</li>
<li>Product horizon</li>
</ul>


<p>You could easily come up with a <a href="/you-dont-have-to-ask-your-boss-for-a-fast-build-lean-software-development-part-6/">decision rule</a> to help us prioritizing technical debt more quickly, without the need for a formal planning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>In search of an experienced software engineer</h2>

<p>We have been trying to hire such a profile for the last year &hellip; The position is hopefully filled now. During that year, we have tried to mine <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> for candidates. Here is how we did it.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-08-19-mining-github-for-new-hires/github.png" title="Github's banner" ></p>

<p>Software engineers, especially experienced, are known to be hard to find. Over the past months, we had steadily been improving our hiring process :</p>

<ul>
<li>By regularly rewriting and optimizing our job post</li>
<li>By posting it on Twitter</li>
<li>By defining a precise interview template</li>
</ul>


<p>We went from very few applications to :</p>

<ul>
<li>More applications</li>
<li>More experienced candidates</li>
<li>Regular interviews</li>
<li>Effective interviews</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately, we were still not interviewing candidates as skilled as we would have liked to. We were convinced that we were offering a great job : the project is very interesting, and the team is a dream to work in.</p>

<h2>How could we reach more great devs ?</h2>

<p>Someday, I played with <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>&rsquo;s Rest Api and I managed to write a short ruby script that finds the contributors to a given project that are living near Paris (France).</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next ?</h2>

<p>We eventually filled the position before following our github experiment. We might continue some day though ! Here is a list of improvements I thought of :</p>

<ul>
<li>Gather a list of projects that overlap with what we are building</li>
<li>Search for repositories using some keyword or regular expression</li>
<li>List github users that contributed to such projects, that live near us and that know java</li>
<li>Use more complex algorithms to find best candidates (<a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/2010/02/10/algorithmic-recruitment-with-github/">Algorithmic Recruitment With GitHub</a>)</li>
<li>Spend more time socializing on GitHub (<a href="http://www.sourcecon.com/news/2014/01/21/the-complete-guide-to-recruiting-and-sourcing-candidates-on-github/">The Complete Guide To Recruiting And Sourcing Candidates On GitHub</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>It really looks like if software is eating recruitment &hellip;</p>

<time datetime="2015-08-17T05:46:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 17<span>th</span>, 2015</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>EDIT 2017-03-03 : This article is old, I am now using an <a href="/my-ultimate-jira-personal-kanban/">improved Jira Personnal Kanban</a>.</p>

<p>Not long ago, I wrote that <a href="/real-programmers-have-todo-lists/">Real Programmers have TODO lists</a> &hellip; I was wrong, I now work without a TODO list ! So either I&rsquo;m not a real programmer anymore, or I&rsquo;m actually using TODO List v.2.0. Read on !</p>

<h2>Motivations</h2>

<p>My work has become quite varied lately. On top of programming and pairing, I am also doing quite some coaching within the team. For the whole Murex programmers community, I&rsquo;m organizing <a href="https://github.com/murex/murex-coding-dojo">Coding Dojos</a>, <a href="http://www.brownbaglunch.fr/">Brown Bag Lunches</a> and Technical Talk Video Sessions. Finaly, like all of us, I have to cope with my share of organization overhead.</p>

<p>Multitasking was starting to kill me. I was feeling exhausted at the end of the day, with the certainty that I was not getting much done &hellip;</p>

<h2>Personnal Kanban To The Rescue</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a> is a method to organize your work relying on <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/featured/why-limit-work-in-progress/#sthash.QFI0D8l5.dpbs">Work In Progress limits</a> : it minimizes multitasking and encourages prioritization.</p>

<p>As its name suggests it, <a href="http://personalkanban.com">Personal Kanban</a> is simply applying Kanban to your own tasks. It turns out that :</p>

<ul>
<li>My team tasks are already in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a></li>
<li>Some guys have already tried to <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-13472">use JIRA as a todo list</a></li>
<li>JIRA supports Kanban boards with WIP limits and all</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Kanban Board</h2>

<p>In our team, <a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net">TAYARA Bilal</a> had already experimented the approach and asked to JIRA admins to create us a custom project for our todo lists. I piggybacked on it and created my own kanban board. Here is what it looks like.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-08-17-bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/board.png" title="Screenshot of the full JIRA board" ></p>

<h3>Mixing Project Stories And Personnal Tasks</h3>

<p>JIRA allows creating a kanban board that spans many projects ! You can simply choose multiple projects when you setup the board for the first time, or you can edit your board filter like this :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="n">project</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">POPIMDB</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">POPABTODO</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This makes it possible to see <em>all</em> of my work at a glance on the same board.</p>

<h3>Work In Progress Limit</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-08-17-bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/wip.png" title="Zoom on the wip constraints of the JIRA column" ></p>

<p>JIRA allows WIP limits, warning me with a red background when I am multitasking or when I am getting late on my tasks</p>

<h3>Color Conventions</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-08-17-bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/color-cards.png" title="Different colors of JIRA cards" ></p>

<p>JIRA makes it possible to assign different colors to cards, for example</p>

<ul>
<li>Red for tasks that are due soon</li>
<li>orange for cards that are due some time</li>
<li>light brown for project stories</li>
<li>green for other programming tasks</li>
<li>blue for other tasks</li>
</ul>


<h3>Swimlanes</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-08-17-bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/swimlanes.png" title="Closup on a JIRA swimlane" ></p>

<p>JIRA has swimlanes, separating project from personal tasks</p>

<h3>Reports</h3>

<p>An extra bonus with JIRA Kanban board is that they have reports ! Here is my cumulative flow diagram for my first week of usage :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2015-08-17-bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/cumulative-flow.png" title="A screenshot of the JIRA cumulative flow diagram" ></p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Here is the JQL query I used to configure it this way.</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">-- and an empty filter for light brown</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>The End Result</h2>

<p>By setting a WIP limit of 3 on the &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; column, the following naturally happened :</p>

<ul>
<li>Once I have started a programming task, I now defer any other activity in the TODO column until I am finished. (HINT: If you get invited to meetings all the time, lock your agenda with &lsquo;Unbookable&rsquo; days when you start programming)</li>
<li>It actually pushed me into finishing the <a href="https://github.com/philou/concurrency-kata">concurrency-kata</a> training I had started long ago.</li>
</ul>


<p>I also set a high WIP limit (around 10) on the TODO column, this way, I get a kind of warning that next time I finish a programming task, I should take some time off to prune the column.</p>

<p>The overall result is that I do lot less multitasking. I get the feeling of doing steadier, more efficient work.</p>

<p>If you are suffering from multitasking and decide to give it a try, I&rsquo;d love to read about your experience !</p>
