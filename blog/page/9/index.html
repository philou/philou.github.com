  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think I found a way to fix the dirty code problem once and for all &hellip;</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</a> Zaphod Beeblebrox has some anti panic glasses. They feature some special danger detection mechanism that turns them opaque black to save their bearer from panicking.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-06-02-anti-ugly-code-glasses/zaphod.jpg" title="Zaphod Beeblebrox" ></p>

<p><em>(It turns out that Zaphod has two heads &hellip;)</em></p>

<p>In 2016, it&rsquo;s shocking that some many hours are lost by poor developers reading ugly code.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s build anti ugly-code glasses ! We&rsquo;d just need an IDE or editor plugin, connect it to <a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">Sonar</a> in order to get the quality of the current file, and if too bad, shut the glasses black !</p>

<p>Finally the killer feature for augmented reality glasses !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I started to program professionally 15 years ago, a lot of things have changes. A lot of technologies appeared and became mainstream while others fell out of fashion.</p>

<p>As software developers, it is really challenging to stay fit and productive in new technologies. I cannot obviously say that I am an expert in all new technologies, but I can say that I can get up to speed in a pretty short time in nearly all.</p>

<p>If there is a single reason for that I strongly believe it is because &ldquo;I studied my classics&rdquo; !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-30-how-to-keep-up-with-software-technologies/outdated.jpg" title="An outdated computed covered in spider webs" ></p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

<p>At the same time I started to program all day long for my living, I also started to read a lot of programming books on my spare time. This allowed me to learn at night and practice at day, setting everything in my brain.</p>

<p>This might come as a surprise, but I never read a lot of books about the technologies I was using. I&rsquo;d rather study fundamental programming books. These contain a lot of transportable knowledge, unlike in most books about a particular technology.</p>

<p>I believe this is a pretty good use of time since it made me a better programmer and also greatly reduced the time I need to master most new technologies. I can now easily relate them to some more general concept I learned before.</p>

<p>For example, I never read a book about UI. By the time I had to do some UI programming, I had absolutely no issue getting up to speed on the topic. I had already seen quite some UI code examples in other books, I knew that most UI frameworks are built from a set of Object Oriented patterns. Coming from a different perspective, I was even able to suggest improvements to the code that UI experts had not thought of.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that I never read books about a particular technology, sometimes, that&rsquo;s just what you need to start something new. But when I do, I usually find them quite easy to read and digest. And I tend to skip things I intuitively understand and use them as cookbooks containing recipes for particular problems rather than end to end walk-through.</p>

<h2>My books</h2>

<p>As a young programmer this book made me understand that my job was not only about writing code, but about building maintainable systems. It provided me with tools to do so, 10 years later, I can still remember &ldquo;The power of plain text&rdquo;. This is also the book that made me have a first look into Ruby :).</p>

<p>Here is the theory behind all automated IDE refactorings. Reading this book had a profound influence on my coding style. The examples made me understand the difference between readable and unreadable code &hellip; It&rsquo;s also the foundation for any kind of incremental design and architecture. That&rsquo;s the book that got me started with TDD.</p>

<p>This book teaches good object oriented programming. Some say it is tough to read, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth doing so. Among other things, it explains how to use functional programming concept in your object oriented project, by separating Value Objects and Entities for example.</p>

<p>With around 250 pages, it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to find a programming book with a greater value/page ratio. This one will teach you all there is to learn about C, and help you understand everything that was built on top of C (and that&rsquo;s quite a lot &hellip;)</p>

<p>Compared to C, Lisp is at the other side of the language spectrum. Learning C and Lisp gives the ability to put nearly anything in contrast to these 2 languages. Lisp is dynamic, functional and meta. It can be morphed into nearly anything and SICP teaches how to do so. There&rsquo;s a Lisp practice that is invaluable to any programmer : use your language to express your problem as simply as possible. SICP teaches that.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Erlang-Concurrent-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193778553X/ref=sr_1_2?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464667113&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=erlang+programming">Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Erlang-Concurrent-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193778553X/ref=sr_1_2?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464667113&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=erlang+programming"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-30-how-to-keep-up-with-software-technologies/erlang.jpg" title="Cover of the Erlang book" ></a></p>

<p>Neither the C book nor SICP deals with distribution and concurrency. That&rsquo;s what this book does. I had never programmed distributed systems before reading this book. After I read it, I learned how to code for distribution in a maintainable way. The lessons taught by Erlang are applicable in many languages.</p>

<h2>Not the best books</h2>

<p>I did not and will never read all programming books available. There might be newer books that treat the same subjects better, but these books are the ones that taught me the most about our craft. My point is that learning fundamentals and things far away from our daily technologies will teach us more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With time, I discovered a way of explaining the subtleties of my developer job to my uninformed relatives and friends.</p>

<p>Sharing what your developer job is about with others can be very frustrating. Some people think you are &ldquo;Just playing around with computers&rdquo; as if it was not serious work. Others think that it is an extremely Cartesian and solitary activity with no place for communication or creativity. Trying to explain the diversity and richness of a developer&rsquo;s work is often a disappointing experience.</p>

<h2>The book metaphor</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-23-software-is-like-writing-and-revising-a-giant-book/book.jpg" title="An old book" ></p>

<p>I explain to people that writing software is not unlike writing a huge book. A book long many millions of lines. I explain that the challenge is to maintain the whole story of the book coherent. I stress how difficult this is given that no one can take the time to read the full book, that the authors come and go, and that the book is under constant heavy revision.</p>

<h2>Details of our work</h2>

<p>The metaphor is quite valid and even holds about more subtle aspects of our work. Here is a summary of the last discussion I had about the book metaphor :</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>(Him) Do you have some &lsquo;gatekeepers&rsquo; for different sections of the story to make sure that these parts remain coherent ?</li>
<li>(Me) That&rsquo;s what we would call strong code ownership, this was the norm 20 years ago, but that the industry is moving to more collective code ownership, in order to decrease the bus factor.</li>
<li>(Him) What is the bus factor ?</li>
<li>(Me) The number of person who need to be hit by a bus to block your development progress</li>
<li>(Him) I see, that&rsquo;s kind of funny. But then, does that mean that any developer can change any part of the code ? Isn&rsquo;t that dangerous ?</li>
<li>(Me) Sure that would be difficult, that&rsquo;s not really how we do it. We make a lot of efforts to split the big story in many smaller independent ones as much as possible. This way, teams specialize on different &lsquo;chapters&rsquo; and work collectively within it.</li>
<li>(Him) I see</li>
<li>(Me) And if you need to change something in another &lsquo;chapter&rsquo; you should ask the guys who know it better to help you.</li>
<li>(Him) That makes sense. And what happens if two developers want to modify the same part of the story at the same time</li>
<li>(Me) That can happen. People might even want to modify the story in conflicting ways ! We&rsquo;ve got tools, processes and best practices to minimize this. If nothing is done, we&rsquo;ll get what we call a &lsquo;merge conflict&rsquo;.</li>
<li>(Him) Ho &hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed, but it seems collaboration is really important in your work, isn&rsquo;t it ?</li>
<li>(Me) Sure it is !</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>We are software writers</h2>

<p>All this reminds me of DHH&rsquo;s talk about writing software :</p>

<p>I had been switching to <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> in <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to host my Octopress installation, but that did not seem related &hellip;</p>

<h2>Plan A : Upgrade Octopress</h2>

<p>It turned out it was related to my migration to Vagrant and Docker.xs This kind of nasty error often comes from obsolete environment. <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1173">Internet confirmed</a> confirmed it :</p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu now uses Python3 instead of Python2</li>
<li>Octopress2 uses an old version of Pygments</li>
<li>That version of Pygments requires Python2</li>
</ul>


<p>I thought that I did not want to play <a href="/ruby-thirdparties-best-practices/">this game</a> against open source libs, so I set out to update. Octopress 3 has been released. It&rsquo;s not yet documented yet, and there is no official upgrade guide, but some guys have done it :</p>

</ul>


<p>I tried it &hellip; but I stopped before the end. It&rsquo;s kind of working, but fundamental features like category archives required too much Jekylling for me at the time. And themes are still an issue &hellip; I mean, stock theme uses a clean and simple gem based update workflow, but most other themes rely on a tricky git clone-merge update workflow.</p>

<h2>Plan B : Find a hosted blog engine for hackers</h2>

<p>I found quite a few options :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> Looks cool, but there is no simple migration tool, and I&rsquo;ve been burned by postero.us shutting down, I want to keep control on my content</li>
<li><a href="https://posthaven.com/">Posthaven</a> Having loved postero.us, this one seems cool, It&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;m not sure the guys are keeping the motivation to increase their feature list with their current business model</li>
<li><a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> Looked great, but too expensive for me (19$ per month)</li>
<li><a href="http://codrspace.com">Codrspace</a> This is a special blogging platform for coders, but it seems it has not been updated for a long time</li>
<li><a href="https://logdown.com/">LogDown</a> This also is a special blogging platform for hackers. It seemed great and had everything I was looking for &hellip; I was ready to spend the 50$ per year for it as it could save me a lot of hassle. Unfortunately, I could not find a way to forward the categories of a post as <a href="https://twitter.com/pbourgau">Twitter</a> hashtags as I&rsquo;ve been doing with Octopress and <a href="https://feedburner.google.com">Feedburner</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In the end, I was rather disappointed by the alternatives, even though I was ready to pay for them.</p>

<h2>Plan C : Fix the error in Octopress 2</h2>

<p>Eventually, the fix was rather easy. People had fixed it by patching mentos.py file in the pygments.rb gem to run Python 2 instead of the stock Python. That&rsquo;s not great because it means that I&rsquo;d have to redo the patch every time I updated my gems, or rebuilt my workspace. Here is what I added to my Vagrantfile instead :</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get -y install python2.7
</span><span class='line'>sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://github.com/philou/philou.github.com/commit/ae14c511b682295ed7fdcb3b1a818926f803dd3a">Here</a> is the commit on my Github repo.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m sticking with Octopress2 for the moment. Maybe I&rsquo;ll re-try to migrate to Octopress3 later on, when an official migration tool or <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">guide</a> is available. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m still dreaming of my perfect blogging platform :</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>Static HTML generation</li>
<li>Self or SAAS hosted</li>
<li>Great integration with social media and the web</li>
<li>Easy to maintain</li>
<li>Plugable themes</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m looking for my next side project at the moment, that could be a useful one ! Anyone interested ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are a developer and you are not shipping, you&rsquo;re in the danger zone. I believe it&rsquo;s mostly your fault, and it&rsquo;s time to act.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-11-real-developers-ship/deliver.jpg" title="A delivery key on a keyboard" ></p>

<h2>Nothing new</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s been told before. Famous blogs have said the same thing :</p>

<ul>
<li>In Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=290121">Real Programmers ship</a> without any explanation, as if it meant it all.</li>
<li>In Coding Horror <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway/">Version 1 Sucks, But Ship It Anyway</a> Jeff Atwood stresses the benefits of shipping early.</li>
<li>In Coding Horror again <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/shipping-isnt-enough/">Shipping Is Not Enough</a> Jeff Atwood goes one step further and explains that we need to create software that is going to be used.</li>
<li>In his <a href="http://removingalldoubt.com/post/2006/09/19/Fatherly-Advice-To-New-Programmers.aspx">fatherly advice to new programmers</a> Chuck Jazdzewski&rsquo;s says &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get paid to program, you get paid to ship.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<h2>What does it really mean ?</h2>

<p>If you are not shipping, are you really developing something ? Maybe it&rsquo;s more some kind of research project, or maybe you are just there for learning ? <em>Real Developers know what they are in for.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because the quality is too bad, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve been developing poor quality software &hellip; <em>Real developers write quality software.</em> (BTW, shipping bug fixes is not shipping)</p>

<p>If you are not shipping because you don&rsquo;t have yet enough features, that&rsquo;s because your MVP is not small enough (despite the current Skateboard metaphor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgETWBKCRSQ">this</a> is not an MVP). <em>So Real developers follow lean (startup) principles.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because it&rsquo;s much work, that&rsquo;s because you did not automate delivery. <em>Real developers use continuous delivery.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because someone else said so, maybe it&rsquo;s time to convince her. <em>Real developers know how to deal with people.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because you are in a shitty environment &hellip; <em>Real developers work on their skills to be able to quit when needed.</em></p>

<h2>Shipping above all else</h2>

<p>My point is that every developer or organization containing developers should put shipping value as their absolute priority, and things should get a lot simpler.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re doing pair programming almost all the the time in our team. A few weeks ago, we went to <a href="http://www.devoxx.fr/">Devoxx</a> Paris, and 2 team mates used pair programming at a hands on session : they finished way before the others and had the time to take a 30 minute break. Pair programming delivers more &hellip; when it works.</p>

<h2>Flavors of Pair Programming</h2>

<p>Throughout our experience, we have identified some situations where it does or does not work :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Pain Zone         </th>
<th> Skill Zone</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Wandering buddies </td>
<td> Mates</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expert / Novice   </td>
<td> Mentor &amp; Apprentice</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br>


<h2>The Pain Zone</h2>

<p>Pair programming can be painful. It can feel like a waste of time or extremely frustrating. Here are the typical situations and how to fix them.</p>

<h3>The Wandering Buddies</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/going_nowhere.jpg" title="A 'going nowhere' sign" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d get if you asked to newcomers straight out of school to pair program on existing source code on day 1. They&rsquo;d be dabbling here and there, without going anywhere. Each one would try to get the keyboard to try his way, but in the end, no general direction would be followed.</p>

<p>The cure in this case (as often) is to stop and think. At least one in the pair needs to lean how to pair program. It&rsquo;s not difficult, that&rsquo;s just :</p>

<ul>
<li>Discuss and agree on a general plan first</li>
<li>Keep a todo list</li>
<li>Track your advancement on your todo list while you don&rsquo;t have the keyboard</li>
<li>Stop and discuss from time to time</li>
</ul>


<p>By starting that, the pair will quickly move into the &lsquo;mates&rsquo; state.</p>

<h3>The Export / The Novice</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/race.jpg" title="A race where Usain Bolt leave everyone meters behind" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when a &lsquo;lone wolf kind of&rsquo; expert pairs with a junior. The expert picks the keyboard, dashes through the tasks, doesn&rsquo;t make sure his pair follows (which usually means it does not).</p>

<p>Regular pair programming means a change in job responsibilities for such expert programmers. If they were expert doers before, they should now become expert mentors or coaches. That&rsquo;s quite a difference. To them, it means that their goal must be to make his pair finish the task &hellip; It can be very frustrating at first. Nevertheless, the overall skill level in teams doing that increases so fast that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very fulfilling for the team as a whole.</p>

<h2>The Skill Zone</h2>

<p>The is where we want to be. When it happens, pair programming feels productive, interesting and fulfilling. Contrary to what is often thought, this can happen whatever the skill levels of the 2 programmers.</p>

<h3>The Mates</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/to-do-list.jpg" title="A Todo list" ></p>

<p>The programmers have equivalent skills on the subject at hand. They organized in a way that they are both learning from each other. By having to verbalize what and why they are doing things, by challenging each others assumptions and by sometimes doing differently than what they&rsquo;d alone.</p>

<h3>The Mentor &amp; The Apprentice</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/help.jpg" title="People helping each other to climb a mountain" ></p>

<p>Other times, there can be a real difference in skills for what the pair is attempting to do. In this situation, the goal of the most knowledgeable is to train his pair, who&rsquo;s goal is to learn. The task becomes some kind of exercise on which to practice.</p>

<p>During a typical pairing session, a pair might switch many times between mentor and mates states. Each one in the pair might assume the mentor&rsquo;s role for different aspect of the work. At the end of the day, everyone should feel as if they had learned and accomplished good work.</p>

<h2>Last Word of Caution</h2>

<p>Pair programming is exhausting. Don&rsquo;t expect to be able to do 40 hours of pair programming per week. After 6 hours in a day, one usually starts to get a lot less efficient.</p>

<p>Both juniors and experienced programmers also need some time by their own, to experiment things by themselves or to complete a simple task without having worry about explaining everything.</p>

<p>These are the reasons why <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</a> stresses having a sustainable pace and leaving space for <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack time</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In french, we say &ldquo;Le cordonnier est toujours le plus mal chaussé&rdquo; which I found an English equivalent in &ldquo;the shoemaker’s son always goes barefoot&rdquo;. I believe this is nowhere more true than in the software industry !</p>

<p>&ldquo;Software is eating the world&rdquo; they say. Software is now able to do things that only humans used to be. So why the hell are we driving our projects as if we were a horde of amateur hitch hikers ?</p>

<h2>What does it mean to be data driven ?</h2>

<p>Being data driven would allow us to answer questions such as :</p>

<ul>
<li>How much is the feature we delivered last week contributing to the bottom line ?</li>
<li>How much is the feature we are currently developing expected to contribute to the bottom line ?</li>
<li>What are the estimated cost <em>and value</em> of increasing our test coverage of 1% ?</li>
<li>What are the estimated interests and nominal amounts of our current technical debt ?</li>
<li>Which is the most valuable : improving our build system or building this new feature ?</li>
</ul>


<p>Most projects I&rsquo;ve worked in have absolutely no clue about the answers to these questions. The decision is left to experts, to the one with most influence, or simply to the developer, who can do how he thinks is best &hellip;</p>

<h2>The books</h2>

<p>Hopefully, some people are thinking differently, they believe it is possible to quantify all this, they even explain how !</p>

<p>Although this book is getting old, and is a bit outdated when compared to agile development practices, it provides real world examples of how scientific measurement can be applied to software product development.</p>

<h2>An opportunity</h2>

<p>Reading these books was a real eye opener for me. The software development world is plagued with cargo cult and supposed best practices. We follow advises, but most often without verifying if they actually work ! I believe that by applying the techniques in these books, we could create standard ways to measure the values of productivity, technical debt, quality, testing &hellip;</p>

<p>I see real opportunities to avoid a lot of useless argument between proponents of A and B, but also to communicate better with all stakeholders and finally, to reduce stress for all of us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day, neither will be your Lego Office &hellip; This week is Devoxx in Paris, for the occasion, we decided to stream a <a href="/recipes-for-an-agile-workspace/">Lego office</a> experiment that my team did.</p>

<h2>What are Lego Offices</h2>

<p>I wrote about Lego office in a previous post, as a concept and a set of material that would allow teams to easily configure their workspaces as they wish. At that time, I thought of :</p>

<ul>
<li>laptops</li>
<li>extra monitors</li>
<li>tables and chairs on wheels</li>
<li>movable walls</li>
<li>movable white boards</li>
<li>movable wall screens</li>
<li>a good Wifi</li>
</ul>


<h2>Our experiment</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/empty-meeting-area.jpg" title="Meeting area in the empty office" >
<img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/empty-work-area.jpg" title="Work area in the empty office" ></p>

<p>The last floor of our building in Paris has a nice (really) open space area with rolling tables that we could use. We moved all the team there for one week. As we don&rsquo;t have laptops with Wifi, we simply asked for enough power and network plugs.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/setup-work-area.jpg" title="Setup work area" >
<img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/setup-meeting-area.jpg" title="Setup meeting area" >
<img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/setup-rest-area.jpg" title="Setup rest area" ></p>

<p>The place is large enough to have dedicated rest and meeting space. We managed to create a visio setup using our build monitor. We even had a remote lunch once, which we should repeat more often !</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s missing</h2>

<p>Obviously, this was a quick experiment, nothing like a fully architectured Lego workspace, still it helped us to discover issues and blocking points. It turns out that cables <em>are</em> an issue !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/cables.jpg" title="Cables on the floor" ></p>

<p>After getting some feedback throughout the company, it turns out that some developers would never trade their high end connected desktop workstation for a Wifi laptop. Our C++ build can be pretty CPU and network intensive &hellip; I guess that means that a real Lego office might require one of the following :</p>

<ul>
<li>A technical floor with all the place required to bring any kind of cables to your machine</li>
<li>Powerful servers in a data center to do the grunt work for you</li>
<li>Single cable machines (Apple&rsquo;s USB-C is the only one I can think of right now)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Last minute question</h2>

<p>Thinking of it &hellip; could different remote offices such as your home, or a co-working space be considered as Lego blocks ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe your company too has a development program you can use to track and organize your training path. That&rsquo;s already great ! It is often not perfect though. Sometimes, the initiative in itself can feel like an afterthought. Some other times, the process is completely left to the employee and his manager, with varying results, from great to forced upon everyone.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-18-how-we-decentralized-our-companys-training-program/learning.jpg" title="A 'learning' word cloud" ></p>

<h2>How did we rebuild this program in our team</h2>

<p>As you might remember if you read my <a href="/blog/categories/selforganizing/">previous posts</a>, we started a self organization initiative using a <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board</a>. When we tried to decentralize <a href="/how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/">the end of year evaluation</a>, we started discussing the subjects of personal development. We decided to have a dedicated workshop about this subject</p>

<h2>Guiding principles</h2>

<p>In our company, the development program allows a manager to assign specific learning goals to his collaborators, and anyone can also create his own goals to justify going to specific trainings. Starting from that, we agreed that the development program should be used to help anyone in the team to improve skills that are interesting for both the company and the employee. If the employee is interested in something completely unrelated to work, then he should obviously tackle that in his own time. If the company needs its employee to acquire some immediate mandatory skills, then that should be part of the daily job and subject to the end of year evaluation.</p>

<p>The idea is to try to find a win-win combinations, were employees are motivated to work their best at a company that they know helps them to full-fill their long term goals.</p>

<h2>What did we came us with ?</h2>

<p>This workshop was quite effective :</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, everyone is responsible for his own development, it&rsquo;s a chance offered by the company. It cannot be forced unto people.</li>
<li>It is based on volunteer mentorship : everyone should have regular meetings with his mentor to asses his progress on his long term goal, to try to get feedback and ideas about how to move forward. We started by saying that the team leader is the default mentor, but anyone can find another mentor at any moment.</li>
<li>The process starts with the search for a long term goal. Examples are &ldquo;I want to be an agile coach&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I want to be a performance expert&rdquo;</li>
<li>With the help of the mentor if needed, the long term goal should be split in yearly objectives and tracked using <a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/HenrikJanVanderPol/how-to-outperform-anyone-else-introduction-to-okr">OKRs</a></li>
<li>Everyone is free to track his progress has he wishes. Visual tracking makes the discussion with the mentor a lot easier. We have been looking at tools to track OKRs but it was surprisingly difficult to find one that suited our use. Most are enterprisy tools with manager-managee relationships. We just wanted simple personal tracking tools. For my part, I adapted a <a href="https://trello.com/b/MPM4rspd/okrs">Trello</a> board I found on the internet.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After doing a few months of this, I can say that this has a positive aspect on motivation, people told me that they felt more in control of their destiny. Something else I noted, is that junior developers need help and guidance. They often don&rsquo;t really know what they want to do in a few years, so they really need a mentor to help them find out the what and the how. The other side of this is that a team obviously needs senior developers to act as mentor &hellip; among other things.</p>
