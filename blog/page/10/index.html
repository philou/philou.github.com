  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that is a widespread title for blog articles ! Just <a href="https://www.google.fr/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=performance%20is%20a%20feature">search Google</a>, and you&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;Performance is a feature&rdquo; in <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/performance-is-a-feature/">Coding Horror</a> and <a href="http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/performance-is-a-feature-623/">others</a>.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s in it for us ?</h1>

<p>If performance is indead a feature, then it can be managed like any feature :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It should result from use cases</p>

<blockquote><p>During use case X, the user should not wait more than Y seconds for Z</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>It can be split into user stories</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><ul>
<li>Story 1: During use case X, the user should not wait more than 2*Y seconds for Z</li>
<li>Story 2: During use case X, the user should not wait more than Y seconds for Z</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>They can be prioritized against other stories</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s forget about performance for now and deliver functionality A as soon as ready, we&rsquo;ll speed things up later.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s fix basic performance constraints for use case X for now, every story will have to comply with these constraints later.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The performance on these use cases should be automatically tested and non regressed</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><ul>
<li>If we slow things too much and these tests breaks, we&rsquo;ll have to optimize the code.</li>
<li>But as long as we don&rsquo;t break the tests, it&rsquo;s ok to unoptimize the code !</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a chance to stop performance related gut feeling quarrels !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.groupe-patus.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/07-Beautiful-Fruit-Wallpapers.jpg"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-12-17-how-to-setup-a-weekly-fruit-basket-in-no-time/fruit.jpg" title="&#34;A multi-fruit sandwich&#34;" alt="&#34;A multi-fruit sandwich&#34;"></a></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in agile software development, just read Kent Beck&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/B00CF6EJG8/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417609208&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=embrace+change+1st+edition">Extreme Programming Explained : Embrace Change 1st edition</a>. It&rsquo;s only 200 pages, it was written in 1999, but it&rsquo;s still tremendously relevent, and it&rsquo;s got the highest ratio of information per page on the subject.</p>

<p>If you actually read it, you&rsquo;ll notice that Kent emphasizes about having food at the office. He claims that it improves the moral and builds team cohesion.</p>

<p>As my company already provides free drinks, my first attempt was to asked for weekly fresh fruits baskets. They are currently experimenting regular self service fruit baskets deliveries in some offices. Unfortunately not in ours yet. Let&rsquo;s hope it changes soon. Meanwhile, we decided to handle the thing ourselves.</p>

<h2>Here comes the fruit basket lean startup !</h2>

<h3>First, let&rsquo;s setup the simplest way it could possibly work</h3>

<ul>
<li>Invest 10€</li>
<li>Buy some fruits from the closest shop</li>
<li>Put them in a basket next to my desk</li>
<li>Let people buy them for 50c each</li>
<li>Leave a plastic cup next to the basket to receive the money</li>
<li>Hold the accounting public and visible in your wiki for example</li>
<li>Repeat every monday</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-12-17-how-to-setup-a-weekly-fruit-basket-in-no-time/fruits-basket.jpg" title="&#34;Our fruit basket at my desk&#34;" alt="&#34;Our fruit basket at my desk&#34;"></p>

<h3>Then, verify that it is sustainable</h3>

<p>It turns out it works fine !</p>

<h3>&hellip; Until someone started to steal some money !</h3>

<p>If we forgot to hide the money cup before we left in the evening, obvious isn&rsquo;t it ?
We tried the following, in that order :</p>

<ol>
<li>Setup an automatic reminder to hide the money before leaving &hellip; FAIL</li>
<li>Setup a fake webcam and a warning notice &hellip; FAIL</li>
<li>Only keep 1€ worth of change in the money cup, and repeatedly lock up the rest in a safe place &hellip; SUCCESS !</li>
</ol>


<p>With just a bit of time, anyone, anywhere can setup a fresh fruit basket at work. It does improve the moral and build the team.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a french idiom that basicaly is</p>

<blockquote><p>No use to run, all that is needed is to start on time &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>an agile engineer would add</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip; and to go in the good direction</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, velocity or mean cycle time as speed measures have their shortcomings :</p>

<ul>
<li>Can be falsified by story point inflation !</li>
<li>Does not tell the team or its product owner whether they are working on the right thing.</li>
</ul>


<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if we could track the business value we are creating instead ? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more motivating for developpers to know how they are contributing to the bottom line ? Wouldn&rsquo;t it help various people to align inside the organization ?</p>

<h2>How to track and prioritize based on your business value</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Principles-Product-Development-Flow/dp/1935401009/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413953773&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=product+development+flow">Reinertsen&rsquo;s Flow book</a>, we learned that the cost of delay is the main driver of the value creation : the faster you deliver a feature, less you spend the cost of delay of that feature, the more value you are creating for your company. <a href="http://scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/">This article</a> suggests that the cost of delay can be computed with the following formula :</p>

<blockquote><p>cost of delay = f(user business value) + g(time criticality) + h(risk reduction opportunity)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/jchyip/estimating-cost-of-delay/27">This other article</a> suggests that they are different types of tasks that corresponds to the different terms of the formula above.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-10-16-how-to-measure-your-speed-with-your-business-value-lean-software-development-part-3/task-types.jpeg" title="&#34;Different kind of tasks&#34;" alt="&#34;Different kind of tasks&#34;"></p>

<p>Here is how we could link the 2 articles :</p>

<ul>
<li>Stories with deadlines : either through legal or market constraints, not doing this will put you out of business (&lsquo;time criticality&rsquo; in the formula)</li>
<li>Stories that influence the bottom line : by increasing the sales figures when delivered, or decreasing them when not delivered, which is kind of the same (&lsquo;user business value&rsquo; in the formula)</li>
<li>Risk reduction tasks : by mitigating risk or streamlining the process, these tasks actually improve the bottom line of other stories (&lsquo;risk reduction opportunity&rsquo; in the formula)</li>
</ul>


<p>The later type of task will be detailed in other articles. Let&rsquo;s focus on the two others.</p>

<h2>The case of the deadlined feature ?</h2>

<p>First, I&rsquo;d say its business value is 0, until it&rsquo;s too late. You should not be working on it too soon, but you should not be working on it too late neither !</p>

<p>In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413954965&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile+development">The Art of Agile Development</a> James Shore details in great details how an agile team can commit to deliverables (I really recommend this part, I might even write a post about it). He explains that in order to commit, teams should multiply their estimates by 4, or by 1.8 if they are very rigourous in their application of all the XP practices.</p>

<p>So a rule to handle such a task could be to</p>

<ul>
<li>estimate it</li>
<li>multiply that estimate by 4</li>
<li>substract this time from the deadline</li>
<li>prioritize it so that it can be started at that date, but not earlier</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t expect to be creating any value by completing these stories</li>
</ul>


<h2>What&rsquo;s the business value of other typical user stories</h2>

<p><a href="http://scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/">This article</a> suggests that in this case the cost of delay is equal to the business value of the feature for the user. But how can we have an idea of its actual user business value ?</p>

<p>Before actually selling and getting the money, it&rsquo;s just an estimation. With the good information, some people will make better estimates than others, never the less, it&rsquo;s still an estimate. Let&rsquo;s try a &ldquo;Business Value Poker&rdquo; ! Here are a few ideas about how to conduct this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Estimate business value at the same time as you estimate the complexity of a story</li>
<li>Create some business value $ poker estimate cards, write an app for this, or bring in some Poker Chips to estimate the value</li>
<li>Invite some business people (sales, marketting &hellip;) to the meeting to get real knowledge (being organized as a feature team will help)</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://gigaom.com/2012/05/16/social-gaming-to-gambling-states-inch-forward/poker-chips-by-sanzar-murzin/"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-10-16-how-to-measure-your-speed-with-your-business-value-lean-software-development-part-3/all-in.jpg" title="&#34;Hands pushing poker chips for an all-in&#34;" alt="&#34;Hands pushing poker chips for an all-in&#34;"></a></p>

<p>At the end, when you have the estimated cost of delay and duration of every task, you can directly prioritize using the WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) :</p>

<blockquote><p>WSJF = Cost of Delay / Duration</p></blockquote>

<p>Just do the tasks by decreasing order of WSJF.</p>

<p>At the end of the sprint, just as we track the story points we completed with the velocity, we could track the business value we created, that would be our business value speed. If you have access to real sales numbers, it might be interesting to see if it&rsquo;s possible to correlate the figures.</p>

<h2>Afterthoughts</h2>

<p>The more I learn about Lean principles, the more I find our current Issues Tracking Systems (I&rsquo;m used to Jira) limited. They seem to be databases with a nice UI, whereas what we need are tools to help us to make better decisions out of the multitude of items &hellip; How come they do not provide something as simple as the WSJF ?</p>

<h2>Edit 12/09/2014</h2>

<p>I got some pretty positive feedback from practicing these business value pokers. Inviting the product owner forced him to explain in details why he believed some features were more valuable than others. On the opposite, it allowed the developpers to hightlight how some seemingly unimportant stories were critical to a long term goal. In the end, everyone, including the product owner, is asking for more. It&rsquo;s a good practice that helps introducing the business value / cost of delay concept.</p>

<p>This was part 3 of my <a href="/the-flow-book-summary-lean-software-development_part_1/">suite of article about Lean Software Development</a>, Part 2 was <a href="/why-extreme-programming-works-lean-software-development-part-2/">Why eXtreme Programming works ?</a>, Part 4 will be <a href="/measure-the-business-value-of-your-spikes-and-take-high-payoff-risks-lean-software-development-part-4/">Measure the business value of your spikes and take high payoff risks</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been programming for quite some time now, in different teams, using various methodologies. I also had the luck to do XP for at least 3 different projects. To me the conclusion is obvious, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</a> delivers more. Even better, programmers working with XP seem to be happier. The only thing I&rsquo;ve seen that works better than XP, is fine tunning it once the team has mastered the main principles.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-09-11-whats-in-kent-becks-extreme-programming-lean-diet-lean-software-development-part-2/lean-extreme.jpg" title="&#34;An extreme diet pill bottle&#34;" alt="&#34;An extreme diet pill bottle&#34;"></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming#History">XP was first put in place</a> at the Chrysler C3 project for SmallTalk performance issues. After being called for performance issues, <a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/">Kent Beck</a> discovered that these were only the tip of the iceberg, everything was going astray. As the expert in the room, people started to ask him how to organize. I remember reading some time ago that without having thought about it before, he gathered all the most efficient programming techniques he knew together into a new process. XP was born.</p>

<p>So the question is : what did Kent Beck put in XP so that it works so well ? Let&rsquo;s go through the Flow book and its 175 lean product development principles, to see if we get some explanations.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-09-11-whats-in-kent-becks-extreme-programming-lean-diet-lean-software-development-part-2/circles.jpg" title="Concentric circles featuring the 12 core xp practices&#34;" alt="Concentric circles featuring the 12 core xp practices&#34;"></p>

<p>Going through <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices">the 12 core XP practices</a>, the main Scrum ceremonies and a few common additions, I&rsquo;ll try to explain why they work through the Flow book&rsquo;s principles.</p>

<h2>Whole Team</h2>

<p>This is the same thing as Pizza Team, Feature team, Cross Functional Team. It just means put everyone involved in the creation of the product in the same room (On site customer, sales, product people, programmers, quality controllers, operation people &hellip;).</p>

<h2>Planning Game</h2>

<p>The work is split into user stories. The customer then estimates the business value of each story, before the programmers poker estimate the required work for them. The game is then to maximize the scheduled business value creation for the coming iteration (1 to 3 weeks).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Whaoo that&rsquo;s a lot ! I did not expect to find so many principles underlying XP (I even removed principles that were not self explanatory). For the XP practitioner that I am, writing this blog post helped me to deepen understanding of it. As XPers know, XP is quite opiniated, it&rsquo;s both a strength and a weakness if you try to apply it outside of its zone of comfort. This explains why some lean subjects are simply not addressed by XP.</p>

<p>To summarize, here is where XP hits the ground :</p>

<ul>
<li>In spite of its image of &lsquo;a process for nerdy programmers&rsquo; XP turns out to be a quite evolved lean method !</li>
<li>XP anihilates batch size and feedback time</li>
<li>Pair programming is well explained</li>
</ul>


<p>And here is where to look at when you&rsquo;ll need to upgrade XP</p>

<ul>
<li>Better tradeoffs might be found with a real quantitative economical framework</li>
<li>Synchronization principles might help working with other teams</li>
</ul>


<p>Kent Beck could not have read the Flow book when he invented XP, but it seems he just had a bit of advance on the rest of us &hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Principles-Product-Development-Flow/dp/1935401009">The principles of product development flow</a> from Donald G. Reinertsen.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-08-29-the-flow-book-summary-lean-software-development_part_1/flow_book_cover.jpg" title="The cover of the book" ></p>

<p>I read it both for work and for my side projects, and I think it will be useful for both. The book is about lean product development, and is in fact a collection of 175 lean principles that one can study and understand in order to make better decisions when developing new products. The principles are divided into the following 8 categories</p>

<ol>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Queues</li>
<li>Variability</li>
<li>Batch sise</li>
<li>WIP constraints</li>
<li>Cadence, synchronization and flow control</li>
<li>Fast feedback</li>
<li>Decentralized control</li>
</ol>


<p>I really loved the book. I have not been thrilled like that by a book since <a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/">Kent Beck</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416">1st edition of Extreme Programming Explained</a>. Where Kent Beck described some values, principles and practices that work. D.G. Reinertsen has the ambition to help us to quantify these practices in order not move from belief based to fact based decisions. For this, he gives us the keys to creating an economical framework with which we should be able to convert any change option to its economical cost</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-08-29-the-flow-book-summary-lean-software-development_part_1/xp_book_cover.jpg" title="The cover of the book &#34;Extreme Programming Explained&#34;" alt="The cover of the book &#34;Extreme Programming Explained&#34;"></p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking of an economical framework of my own, that I could use on the projects I am currently involved in. This post is the first of a series about this :</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&rsquo;ve encountered this situation in different disguise in different companies, I now assume it&rsquo;s a widely applied antipattern.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>A team of programmers inherits a piece of code from one of their bosses. They find it really difficult to maintain : it is difficult to understand, fix, and change.</p>

<h3>The Antipattern</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-08-10-the-holy-code-antipattern/grenade.jpg" title="A picture from the Monty Python's Holy Grail movie featuring the holy hand grenade of antioch" ></p>

<p>As this piece of code seems too complex to be maintained by a team of simple programmers, as the boss, just forbid them :</p>

<ul>
<li>to refactor any part of it</li>
<li>to rewrite it from scratch</li>
<li>to use something else instead</li>
</ul>


<h3>Consequences</h3>

<ul>
<li>This often limits the number of bugs that appear in this library, but &hellip;</li>
<li>It slows down development, because of the micro management required to enforce this pattern</li>
<li>It frustrates programmers, and it is likely that the best ones will leave</li>
<li>It prevents better design</li>
<li>Even worse, in the long run, it prevents great domain driven design to emerge from merciless refactoring</li>
<li>In the end, it makes the whole organization less performant</li>
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Your boss wrote something a few years ago, if the domain is more or less complex, the resulting code <em>is</em> complicated. The subject eventually got the reputation of being &lsquo;touchy&rsquo;. Your boss is the only person who effectively manages to change anything in there. He&rsquo;s a bit afraid that by trying to improve it, the whole thing might just break down and become a bug nest. So, now that he has some authority, he forbids anyone to touch it. If a change is finally required, he&rsquo;ll micro manage it !</p></li>
<li><p>Your big boss spent some over time on writing an uber-meta-generic-engine to solve <del>the universe and</del> everything. After seeing many developpers fixing the same kind of bugs over and over, he decides that it&rsquo;s time to remove the dust from his compiler and that he starts building something that should solve the root cause of all these. In the spirit of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second system effect</a>, he adds all bells and whistle to his beloved project, trying to incorporate a solution to every different issue he has seen during the last decade. This code grows and grows in total isolation of any real working software. When he eventually thinks it is ready, he justs drops the whole thing to your team, that is now responsible to integrate and use this thing in the running system. He&rsquo;s micro managing the whole thing, and you don&rsquo;t have any choice but to comply and succeed. This usually generates gazillions of bugs, makes projects really late and ruins the developpers&#8217; lives.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Alternatives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use collective code ownership so that knowledge about the code is shared by design</li>
<li>Trust programmers to design and architecture the system</li>
<li>Use constant refactoring to let tailor made domain driven designs emerge from the system</li>
</ul>

<time datetime="2014-06-27T06:33:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 27<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rest In Peace <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/206938/mes-courses.fr/archives/index.html">mes-courses.fr</a>. Here is what it looked like :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-06-27-rip-mes-courses-dot-fr/screenshot.png" title="Screen shot of the home page of mes-courses.fr" ></p>

<p>I wanted to create a really fast on-line grocery front-end, where people could shop for the week in only 5 minutes. It supported shopping recipes instead of individual items but I also envisioned to allow automatic menus recommendations, and automatic item preference selection. I started 4 years ago, and this is my last doing on the subject :). If you&rsquo;re thinking about starting your own side project, this post is for you.</p>

<h3>Here are the lessons I learned</h3>

<ul>
<li>As a professional programmer, I largely underestimated the non programming time required for a serious side project. It represents more than half the time you&rsquo;ll spend on your project (marketing, discussing with people, mock ups and prototypes)</li>
<li>When I started, I kind of estimated the time it would take me to build a first prototype. Again I ridiculously underestimated this :

<ul>
<li>because of the previous point</li>
<li>because on a side project, you&rsquo;ll be on your own to handle any infra issue</li>
<li>because you don&rsquo;t have 8 hours per day to spend to your project (As a professional developer, dad of 2, I only managed to get 10 to 15 hours per week)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/programming-as-an-exponential-problem/">A small project does not require as much infrastructure as a big one</a>. I lost some time doing things as I do when working on projects with more than 100K lines of code. So next time :

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll stick to end to end cucumber tests for as long as possible</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll use an economical framework like described in <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/The-Principles-Product-Development-Flow/dp/1935401009">Donald G. Reinertsen&rsquo;s Flow book</a> to prioritize improvements vs features</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eventually, what killed me was that I could not go around the &ldquo;experiment &ndash;> adapt&rdquo; loop fast enough. The project was just too big for my time

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll try to select a subject a project that suits my constraints of time and money</li>
<li>This will be one of the first hypotheses that I&rsquo;m willing to verify</li>
<li>Web marketing and HTML design are more important than coding skills to run experiments : I&rsquo;m learning both</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scrapping is a time hog. I won&rsquo;t start any side project involving scrapping anymore.</li>
<li>Using on-line services always saved me a lot of time. They are a lot more reliable than anything I could setup. Mainly, this was :

<ul>
<li>Mailing services</li>
<li>Cloud deployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go the standard way. Again, anytime I did something a bit weird, it turned out to cost me some time

<ul>
<li>Use standard open source software, stick to the latest version</li>
<li>Use standard and wide spread technology</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automated testing and deployment saved me some time from the start. Especially with the small amount of time that I could spend on my project, it was really easy to forget details and to make mistakes.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/blob/master/lib/mes_courses/deployment.rb">Here</a> is the <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> deployment script I used to test and deploy in a single shell call</li>
<li>And <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/blob/master/lib/mes_courses/utils/scheduled_tasks.rb">here</a> is a Heroku workaround to run some cron tasks weekly, this allowed me to run some scrapping tests every week on Heroku</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It took all my time ! Next time I start a side project, I&rsquo;ll be prepared to

<ul>
<li>Spend all my free time on it (my time was divided between day-job, family, side project)</li>
<li>Spend all my learning time (books, on-line trainings &hellip;) for it</li>
<li>Choose something that I am passionate about !</li>
<li>Choose a different kind of project to fit my constraints

<ul>
<li>Joining an existing open source project would let me focus on technical work at my own pace</li>
<li>Volunteer for a not for profit project might be less time intensive while allowing some fulfilment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I did my project alone, and it was hard to keep my motivation high on the long run. Next time :

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll join someone else</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll <a href="/my-own-side-project-best-practices-after-reading-the-side-project-book/">time box my project</a> before a pivot or starting something completely different</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I did not manage to get anything done before I settled a regular daily rhythm. I used to work from 5:30am to 7:30am, I first tried in the evening, but after a day&rsquo;s work, I was too tired to be really productive.</li>
<li>When I could afford it, paying for things or services really saved me some time. I&rsquo;m thinking of

<ul>
<li>A fast computer</li>
<li>Some paying on-line services</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>It is sure that doing a side project seriously is a heavy time investment, but there&rsquo;s also a lot of benefits !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-06-27-rip-mes-courses-dot-fr/side-projects-are-important.gif" title="Side projects are important blackboard" ></p>

<h3>Here is what I gained</h3>

<ul>
<li>Real experience with new technologies. For me, this included

<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Coffeescript</li>
<li>HTML scrapping</li>
<li>Dev-ops practices with Heroku</li>
<li>Web design with HTML and CSS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I also learned a lot of non technical skills in which I was completely inexperienced

<ul>
<li>Web marketing</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Mailing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trying to bootstrap a for profit side project is like running a micro company, it&rsquo;s a good opportunity to understand how a company is ran. This can help you to become a better professional during your day-job.</li>
<li>Having control on everything is a good situation to use Lean techniques.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404024050&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lean+startup">Lean Start-up</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Principles-Product-Development-Flow/dp/1935401009/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404024094&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=reinersten">Lean product development (Donald G. Reinertsen)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failing allowed me to actually understand Lean Start up ! The ideas are easy to understand in theory, the practice is a very different thing. It should help me for my next project.</li>
<li>Resolving real problems on my own was a very good source for valuable blog articles.</li>
<li>I collaborated with very clever people on open source libraries

<ul>
<li>By fixing some bugs in some libraries I was using</li>
<li>By releasing some parts of my code as open source libraries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Next time, I hope I&rsquo;ll get more euros as well !</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got nothing to loose from trying ! Just do it. Give yourself 1 year to get some small success, and then continue or repeat with something else !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everybody knows about the agile software development promise &ldquo;Regularly and continuously deliver value&rdquo;. This is how it is supposed to work :</p>

<ul>
<li>Iterative</li>
<li>Focusing on what is needed now</li>
<li>Release as soon as possible</li>
<li>Planning small stories according to the team&rsquo;s velocity</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-06-15-enabling-agile-practices-and-elephant-taming/squirrel.jpg" title="A business A squirrel jumping from one tree to another (source mayamumu.centerblog.net)" ></p>

<p>It all seems common sense and simple. Especialy for people who don&rsquo;t code. That&rsquo;s not the whole story though, let&rsquo;s have a look at a few variations :</p>

<p>Suppose a team uses <a href="http://www.scrum.org">Scrum</a> but does not do any automated testing. As soon as the software will be used, bugs will create havoc in the planning. The velocity will quickly fall, within a few monthes, the team won&rsquo;t be able to add any value. Surely, things could be improved with some rewrite and upfront design &hellip; this does not sound like Scrum anymore.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s suppose that another team is also using Scrum, uses automated tests, but <a href="/sprints-are-not-sprints/">missunderstood Sprint</a> and KISS for quick-and-dirty-coding. Hopefully, this team won&rsquo;t get too many bugs in production ! Unfortunately, any change to the source code will trigger hundreds of test failures : again, the velocity will decrease. I&rsquo;ve been in such projects, in about 2 years, the team got really slow, and might eventually drop their test suit &hellip;</p>

<p>These two examples show that automated testing improves the situation, but also that it is not enough ! There are quite a few agile practices that are in fact <em>enabling</em> practices. These are the practices that are required for the process to accomplish the agile promise described at the begining of this article. Most come from <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> and have been reincarnated through <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship</a>. That&rsquo;s what Kent Beck meant when he said that XP practices reinforce each other. Here are a few examples :</p>

<p>For example let&rsquo;s take <strong>coding standards</strong> and <strong>pair programming</strong> which really seem to be a programmer choice.
It turns out that they help to achieve <strong>collective code ownership</strong>.
Which in turn helps to get &lsquo;switchable&rsquo; team members.
Which helps to make good team estimates.
Which is required to have have a reliable <strong>velocity</strong>.
Which is a must have to regularly <strong>deliver value</strong> on commitment !</p>

<p>It turns out that all of the other original <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">XP practices</a> help to achieve the agile promise.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2014-06-15-enabling-agile-practices-and-elephant-taming/elephant-in-the-room.jpg" title="A business meeting with a real elephant in the room" ></p>

<p>After a lot of time spent writing software, I now tend to think of the code as the elephant in the room. It directly or indirectly constrains every decision that is make. Recognize and tame your elephant or you&rsquo;ll get carted away &hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip; or dragged away &hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip; or trampled &hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just compiled my Gherkin and Cucumber goodies into a gem. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/cucumber_tricks">cucumber_tricks</a> and the source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/philou/cucumber_tricks">github</a>. It&rsquo;s also tested on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/philou/cucumber_tricks">travis</a> and documented in details on <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/philou/cucumber-tricks/docs">relish</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of all these tricks is to be able to write more natural english scenarios. Here is an extract from the readme of the gem, which explains what it can do :</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I already wrote a lot about test proxies (<a href="/how-to-stub-around-a-call-to-the-original-method-with-rspec/">here</a>, <a href="/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">here</a> and <a href="/my-humble-advices-about-how-to-write-maintainable-tests/">here</a>).</p>

<p>I just took the time to transform my previous gist in a full fledged ruby gem. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;rspecproxies&rdquo; and it can be found <a href="https://github.com/philou/rspecproxies">on github</a>. It&rsquo;s fully tested, documented and there&rsquo;s a usage section in the readme to help anyone get started.</p>

<p>Here are the pain points proxies try to fix :</p>

<ul>
<li>Without mocks, it is sometimes just awfully painfull to write the test (do you really want to start a background task just to get a completion ratio ?)</li>
<li>With classic stubs, you sometimes have to stub things you are not interested in in your test, you end up with unmaintainable extra long stub setup</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at a few examples of tests with proxies :</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify actual load count without interfering in any behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;d really love to see more code tested with proxies, it makes the whole testing so much more natural. As with any testing techniques, we get more thorough testing from the ease of writing the test.</p>
