  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is my second post relating the talks I attended at JavaOne 2016. <a href="/top-5-talks-i-attented-at-java-one-2016-part-1/">Here</a> is the beginning of the story. Here we go.</p>

<h2>Euphoria Despite the Despair</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/holly_cummins">Holly Cummins</a></p>

<p>Our jobs aren&rsquo;t always fun &hellip; and that&rsquo;s in fact an issue ! Studies show that people who have fun at work are 31% more productive ! The talk was organized in 3 parts :</p>

<ol>
<li>What is fun ?</li>
<li>How to remove the parts that are not fun ?</li>
<li>How to add even more fun ?</li>
</ol>


<p>She defined what she called the funtinuum, which is that fun is a function of engagement and interaction. Basically, you won&rsquo;t have fun if you are doing nothing, or if no one cares about your work. That aligns well with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475123675&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=daniel+pink+drive">Daniel Pink&rsquo;s drivers of motivation</a> : Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose.</p>

<p>If something is not fun, it&rsquo;s because it does not require engagement or interaction. It&rsquo;s either boring or no one cares, or both. If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s probably some kind of waste in some sense &hellip; Removing un-fun activities would mean removing waste. It&rsquo;s interesting to note how this sounds like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muda_(Japanese_term">lean Muda</a>) ! She gave examples such as :</p>

<ul>
<li>automate stuff</li>
<li>pair programming transforms criticism into collaboration (bonus: it gives excuse to skip meetings)</li>
<li>go <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NoEstimates">#NoEstimates</a> because estimating is painful and useless</li>
<li>YAGNI defers useless things until they really add value</li>
<li>Organize to skip meetings and other boring stuff</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>Last step is to add fun to the workplace. She warned that adding fun before removing the un-fun stuff would feel fake and would make things worse &hellip;</p>

<p>To add fun, she suggested using things like :</p>

<ul>
<li>gamification (there was actually another great talk about gamification)</li>
<li>build a hacking contest instead of a security training</li>
<li>Install a <a href="https://sirenofshame.com/">Siren of Shame</a> for whoever breaks the build</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Java 9: The Quest for Very Large Heaps</h2>

<p>Bernard Traversat, Antoine Chambille</p>

<p><a href="/imgs/2016-09-28-top-5-talks-i-attended-at-javaone-2016-part-2/java-9-gc.jpg"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-28-top-5-talks-i-attended-at-javaone-2016-part-2/java-9-gc-small.jpg" title="Slide of the memory regions in G1" ></a></p>

<p>This talk might not be of interest for all, but it is for us <a href="http://murex.com">at work</a>. It went through the improvement to come to Java 9&rsquo;s G1 garbage collector. To summarize, to scale to very large heaps, it will split the memory into regions. Objects should be allocated on different regions depending on their specificities, which might help to build NUMA aware applications. Having the heap split up in smaller chunks enables the GC to run in parallel, which can speed up the old generation GC by up to 50 times !</p>

<h2>Agility and Robustness: Clojure + spec</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stuarthalloway">Stuart Halloway</a></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been touching Clojure for a while but I gave the language a try a few years ago. I had heard about Clojure spec but hadn&rsquo;t taken the time to look at it in details. As I understood it all, Spec is like some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design by Contract</a> on steroïds ! Clojure is not statically typed, but you can now assign spec metadata to values. A spec is roughly a predicate. By defining specs for the inputs and outputs of functions, it is possible to verify at runtime that the function is behaving correctly.</p>

<p>As did Bertrand Meyer in the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Book-CD-ROM/dp/0136291554/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475211259&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=object+oriented+software+construction+meyer">OOSC2</a>, who advised to use contracts during development only, Stuart explained that we should care about developer vs production time instead of compile vs runtime. From this point of view, it is not of great importance whether the compiler or the continuously running test suite finds an issue.</p>

<p>But specs are a lot more than predicates ! They can be used to :</p>

<ul>
<li>enable assertions at runtime</li>
<li>generate documentation</li>
<li>generate test cases</li>
<li>generate precise call logs</li>
<li>get precise error messages</li>
<li>explore a function and see how it can be called</li>
</ul>


<p>He went on to compare the virtues of Clojure spec with static typing (à la Java) and example based testing :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-28-top-5-talks-i-attended-at-javaone-2016-part-2/clojure-spec.jpg" title="Slide comparing Clojure spec with example based testing and static typing" ></p>

<p>Although I don&rsquo;t believe that generative testing can ever replace example based testing altogether, it certainly can help.</p>

<p>All in all, the presentation was insanely great and engaging. It made me seriously think of going into Clojure programming again !</p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://t.co/0FBl2l473N">the slides</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNTQ-M_uSo8">the same talk at Strangeloop</a></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, JavaOne was great ! If I had the opportunity, I&rsquo;d go back every year ! There was a lot of other great talks I did not write about in these 2 posts, for example :</p>

<ul>
<li>Development Horror Stories was a lot of fun, especially the winning story !</li>
<li>Hacking Hiring was full of good advises</li>
<li>Managing Open Source Contributions in Large Organizations was full of good ideas</li>
<li>Increasing Code Quality with Gamification was very inspiring</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With a few other colleagues, I had the chance to be sent to San Francisco last week to attend the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne 2016</a> conferences by my <a href="http://www.murex.com">company</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/imgs/2016-09-28-top-5-talks-i-attented-at-javaone-2016-part-1/exhibition-hall.jpg"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-28-top-5-talks-i-attented-at-javaone-2016-part-1/exhibition-hall-small.jpg" title="Photo of the JavaOne exhibition hall" ></a></p>

<p>Here is super short list of the conferences I attended which I found really interesting</p>

<h2>Preventing errors before they happen</h2>

<p><a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wdietl/">Werner Dietl</a> &amp; <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/">Michael Ernst</a></p>

<p>Since Java 6, it is possible to pass custom annotation processors to javac. Since Java 8, it is possible to add annotations to types. The guys behind the <a href="http://checkerframework.org">Checker Framework</a> used this to create custom pluggable type systems for your Java programs. These type systems enforce properties on your program, and will emit warnings or errors at compile time otherwise.</p>

<p>Here are a few example :</p>

<ul>
<li>declare <code>@Immutable MyObject myObject</code> to make sure that myObject won&rsquo;t be muted</li>
<li>declare <code>@NonNull MyObject myObject</code> to make sure that myObject is never null</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="/imgs/2016-09-28-top-5-talks-i-attented-at-javaone-2016-part-1/type-systems.jpg"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-28-top-5-talks-i-attented-at-javaone-2016-part-1/type-systems-small.jpg" title="Architecture of the type checker" ></a></p>

<p>Under the hood, the compiler behaves as if <code>@Immutable MyObject</code> and <code>MyObject</code> where completely separate types, and it knows and tracks specific ways of converting between the two. The framework provides a simple API to define your own type systems. They did a live demo showing how to quickly define things like <code>@Regex String</code>, <code>@Encrypted String</code> or <code>@Untainted String</code> (which forbids user input strings to avoid SQL injections).</p>

<p>The talk was really interesting, the framework seems lightweight and to integrate well with the typical tool stack. I definitely will give it a try the next time I have a bit of slack time.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/2016-javaone/2016-09-19%20CF%20@%20JavaOne.pdf">the slides</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb6nz85jbuQ">previous session of the presentation</a></p>

<h2>Keeping Your CI/CD Pipeline as Fast as It Needs to Be</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/abrahammarin?lang=fr">Abraham Marin-Perez</a></p>

<p>Continuous Delivery and Microservices are what you need to do, aren&rsquo;t they ? Well, when actually trying to setup a CI / CD pipeline for all your code, things quickly get complicated pretty fast ! The speaker presented how to deal with this complexity by using metrics from your VCS and build servers to draw an annotated graph of your build pipeline.</p>

<p><a href="/imgs/2016-09-28-top-5-talks-i-attented-at-javaone-2016-part-1/build-pipeline.jpg"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-28-top-5-talks-i-attented-at-javaone-2016-part-1/build-pipeline-small.jpg" title="Graph of the build pipeline" ></a></p>

<ul>
<li>He used the build time to set the size of every node : the longer, the larger</li>
<li>The color for the change rate : the more often it was built the warmer the color</li>
</ul>


<p>It was then possible to determine other metrics such as :</p>

<ul>
<li>the impact time of every node : build time + build time of all the dependencies</li>
<li>the weighted impact time : impact time * change rate</li>
<li>the overall average impact time : sum of all the weighted impact times</li>
<li>the overall max impact time : max of all the impact times</li>
</ul>


<p>Using this and your SLAs it is possible to define policies for your build times such as &ldquo;the max build time should not be more than X&rdquo;. If you want to speed up your build, you can set a target build time and analyzing the graph should help you to understand what architecture changes you need to make to your system in order to meet this build time (this sounds a lot like <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/The_Improvement_Kata.html">Toyota&rsquo;s Improvement Kata</a> &hellip;)</p>

<p>I loved this talk ! I found the speaker captivating, he presented novel ideas which is not always the case.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AbrahamMarinPerez/keeping-your-cicd-pipeline-as-fast-as-it-needs-to-be">the slides</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JxoKJng_eQ">the same presentation at Devoxx UK</a>.</p>

<h2>To Be Continued</h2>

<p>I promised 5, and that&rsquo;s only 2 talks ! Stay tuned, I&rsquo;ll write about the 3 others in the coming weeks. <a href="/top-5-talks-i-attended-at-javaone-2016-part-2/">Here they are</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the years doing some coding dojos with the same circle of people, I came up with my own style of practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>. Lately, I had the chance to do a pair programming session with someone I did not know. That made me realize that they are in fact even more ways to practice TDD than I thought.</p>

<h2>Mockist vs Classisist</h2>

<p>A lot has already been written (and discussed) about these two approaches. I myself have already <a href="/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">blogged</a> about the subject, I even gave a <a href="/how-not-to-use-mocks-my-talk-at-paris-rb/">talk</a> about it. From my own point of view, I believe that the inconvenients of making mocking the default far outweights the benefits. I&rsquo;m not saying that mocks aren&rsquo;t useful from time to time, but rather that they should remain the exception.</p>

<h2>Top-Down vs Bottom-Up</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s the reason why I wrote this post. This is the main difference I found between my style and my pair&rsquo;s. Let me explain.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-20-flavours-of-tdd/topdown-vs-bottomup.jpg" title="Top-Down vs Bottom-Up" ></p>

<h3>Top-Down</h3>

<p>Doing TDD top-down means starting with high level end to end tests, implementing the minimum to make it work, refactor and repeat. A bit like BDD, the point is to focus on the expected behavior, and avoid writing useless things. The bad point is that the refactoring part can get pretty difficult. On real life code, strictly following top-down would mean writing a feature test first, passing it with a quick and dirty implementation, to then spend hours trying to refactor all that mess &hellip; good luck !</p>

<p>Here is another example, from coding dojos this time. Having had success with the top-down approach during previous dojos, we once intentionally tried to code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#">Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life</a> using a top-down approach. We did so by writing high level tests that were checking special patterns (gliders &hellip;). That was a nightmare ! It felt like trying to reverse engineer the rules of the game from real use cases. It did not bring us anywhere.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-20-flavours-of-tdd/glider.gif" title="Conway's game of life gliders" ></p>

<h3>Bottom-Up</h3>

<p>At the other side of the spectrum, you can do bottom-up TDD. This means unit testing and implementing all the small bricks you think you&rsquo;ll need to provide the expected overall feature. The idea is to avoid tunnels and to get fast feedback on what you are coding. The bad side is that you might be coding something that will end up being unnecessary. Be careful, if you find yourself spending a lot of time building up utility classes, you might be doing too much bottom-up implementation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals">Numerals to Romans Kata</a> is a good exercise to fail at bottom-up. Every time I did this exercise during a coding dojo, people new to it would start to come up with complicated ways to do it (often involving complex array manipulation). Compared to that, applying disciplined bottom-up TDD brings a <a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Algorithm-Roman-Numeral-Converter">brutally effective solution for Numerals to Romans</a>.</p>

<h2>Mixed approach</h2>

<p>Both approaches have their pros and cons. I really believe developers who are serious about TDD should master both, and learn when to apply each. In fact, as often, the best approach lies somewhere in the middle. Here&rsquo;s my recipe :</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a high level feature test</li>
<li>try to make it pass &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; (usually) fail</li>
<li>rollback or shelve your test and draft implementation</li>
<li>build a brick</li>
<li>unshelve</li>
<li>try to make it pass &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; and so one until the high level test finally passes.</li>
</ol>


<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s a lot like the <a href="https://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/">Mikado Method</a> for building features instead of refactoring.</p>

<h2>Practice in dojos</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to intentionally practice this in coding dojos as well. Most kata should be OK, as long as the group agrees to fix it using this particular approach up front.</p>

<p>If during the dojo, you&rsquo;ve just written a test, suddenly realize that it won&rsquo;t be easy to get it passing, and that you&rsquo;ve got the elements spread out in your code, this is the time ! Comment the test, get the green bar, refactor, uncomment the test, try to make it pass, repeat &hellip; Eventually, you&rsquo;ll have all the bricks to make it easy to pass your test.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-20-flavours-of-tdd/cargo-cult.jpg" title="Cargo Cult : People thought that by building something that looks like a plane, they would be able to fly" ></p>

<p>Some might say this is not &lsquo;pure&rsquo; TDD, but that sounds like cargo cult to me ! As long as you make sure you are not building useless stuff, and that you keep the feedback loop as short as possible, you&rsquo;re on the right track.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I posted my latest article <a href="/is-there-any-room-for-the-not-passionate-developer/">Is There Any Room for the Not-Passionate Developer ?</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hackernews</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">Reddit Programming</a>. The post stayed on the fist page for a while, and I got a lot of traffic. If you are yourself blogging, you might be interested to know how it occurred, and what I learned in the process.</p>

<h2>How it started</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-05-how-to-use-hackernews-and-reddit-for-blogging/soft-skills.jpg" title="The cover of 'Soft Skills, the software developer's life manual'" ></p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473135683&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=soft+skills">Soft Skills, the software developer&rsquo;s life manual</a> John Somnez explains that posting your blog articles on HN or Reddit might bring you a ton of traffic, but that comments can be hard to swallow at time. Within a few hours of writing my blog post it had generated some positive activity on twitter (favorites and retweets) from my regular followers. That&rsquo;s a good sign that the post is good enough. As I had promised myself in such case, I submitted the post to both HN and Reddit.</p>

<h2>What happened ?</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-09-05-how-to-use-hackernews-and-reddit-for-blogging/google-analytics.jpg" title="A Google Analytics screenshot, with the traffic spike" ></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure on Reddit, but I know my post stayed on the first page of HN for a few hours, it even went up to the third place for a while. In the process I got a lot of traffic, a lot more than I am used to. I also got a ton of comments, on HN, Reddit and directly on my post. John Somnez had warned that comments on HN and Reddit can be very harsh, so I went through these quickly, took notes about the points that seemed interesting, but I only responded to comments on my website.</p>

<p>Overall, the comments were pretty interesting though, and brought a lot of valid points. I&rsquo;m planning to write a &lsquo;response&rsquo; article to take all these into perspective.</p>

<p>Most of the traffic was made in the day I submitted my post, but I had more traffic than usual for 2 or 3 days. Since then, the traffic has settled down, but I now get between 2 and 5 times more traffic than I typically had on a daily basis ! An online Taiwanese tech magazine also asked me the permission to translate <a href="http://www.inside.com.tw/2016/08/05/is-there-any-room-for-the-not-passionate-developer">my post in Chinese</a> !</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the performance of my website during the traffic spike. I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> to statically generated html on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, so that should be fine. I am also using a custom domain, and I need to make sure my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7738293">DNS is correctly configured</a> for this to perform well.</p>

<h2>Advice for bloggers</h2>

<p>So here is what I am going to do regarding HN and Reddit in the future :</p>

<ol>
<li>It can bring so much traffic and backlinks that I&rsquo;ll definitely continue to submit blog posts from time to time</li>
<li>For the moment, I&rsquo;ll stick to only submitting the articles from which I already received good feedbacks, I don&rsquo;t want to get a bad karma or reputation on these websites</li>
<li>I might submit old articles that gathered good reviews at the time I wrote them</li>
<li>Concerning comments, I&rsquo;ll try to grow an even thicker skin. Maybe at some point I&rsquo;ll try to answer on HN or Reddit</li>
</ol>


<p>Of course, depending how this works, I will adapt !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you get your kids to participate with housekeeping ? I guess that&rsquo;s the dream of all parents. As so, we&rsquo;ve tried quite a lot of tactics throughout the years. Carrots and stick never really worked, so we tried positive reinforcement, gratitude &hellip; Unfortunately, nothing really made any noticeable improvement.</p>

<h2>Until now !</h2>

<p>At work, we&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://management30.com/practice/intrinsic-motivation/">Kudo Boxes</a> for a <a href="/how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/">while now</a>. A kudo box is a small mailbox where teammates can drop a word of thank or some praise (No blame allowed here !)</p>

<p>Why not try the same thing at home ? During the summer holidays, we&rsquo;ve build kudo boxes for everyone in the family.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-08-30-kudo-boxes-for-kids/kudo-box.jpg" title="Our family Kudo Box" ></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nice and easy way to express gratitude for any good stuff our kids do. The great thing is that it&rsquo;s cheap, it&rsquo;s easy to carry cards around and to hand one out at any moment.</p>

<h2>What happened ?</h2>

<p>First, we now have very joyful kudo reading sessions : our kids rush to the boxes to check for new cards. The second most noticeable change we observed is that they are both participating more in the house chores ! For example, as soon as we start cooking, they might spontaneously dress the table up. Or they might bring tools to help us as best as they can when we are tending to the garden.</p>

<p>To summarize, it seems it brought a lot of joy and love in the house.</p>

<h2>How we started ?</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-08-30-kudo-boxes-for-kids/typical-kudo-box.jpg" title="The typical employee's kudo box, as can be found on the management 3.0 website" ></p>

<p>They are many ways to build a kudo box. The simplest way might be to get an old shoe box, and to cut a hole in the cover. We bought a wooden box with four drawers, and spent some time all together to decorate it. This in itself was already fun.</p>

<p>We started using simple pieces of paper as kudo cards, but I later downloaded and printed a bunch of <a href="https://management30.com/product/kudo-cards/">official kudo cards</a> from the Management 3.0 website. It turns out there is a version in <a href="https://1qjpt15fhlq3xjfpm2utibj1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Management30-KudoCards-2015-self-print-A4-French.pdf">french</a>.</p>

<h2>Bonus</h2>

<p>An unexpected, but great, side effect is that my spouse and I started to get kudos as well ! It&rsquo;s really nice to receive a word from your kids. For example, here is a drawing I got from my daughter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-08-23-rspecproxies-now-supports-to-receive-xxx-dot-dot-dot-syntax/test_probes.jpg" title="Hardware test probes" ></p>

<p>Pure mocks are dangerous. They let defect go through, give a false sense of security and are difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already talked about it <a href="/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">before</a> but since then, <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">DHH announced that he was quitting TDD</a>, the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/">Is TDD Dead ?</a> debate took place, and the conclusion is that <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/mockists-are-dead-long-live-classicists">mockist are dead</a>.</p>

<p>They are still times when mocks feel much simpler than any other things. For example, imagine your process leaks and crashes after 10 hours, the fix is to pass an option to a thirdparty, how would you test this in a fast test ? That&rsquo;s exactly the kind of situation where using test proxies saves you from mocks. A test proxy defers everything to the real object but also features unintrusive hooks and probes that you can use in your test. If you want a code example, check <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/commit/2c9fce17f9b59d0b3828f309015c07b17cceddf4?diff=split">this commit</a>, where I refactored a rails controller test from mocks to a RSpecProxies (v0.1).</p>

<p>I created RSpecProxies <a href="/my-new-gem-for-creating-rspec-proxies/">a while ago</a>, a while ago, and it&rsquo;s syntax made it alien to the RSpec work, it needed an update. <a href="http://rspec.info">RSpec</a> now supports basic proxying with partial stubs, spies, the <code>and_call_original</code> and the <code>and_wrap_original</code> methods. <a href="https://github.com/philou/rspecproxies">RSpecProxies 1.0</a> is a collection of hooks built on top of these to make proxying easier, with a syntax that will be familiar to RSpec users.</p>

<h2>Before original hook</h2>

<p>This hook is triggered before a call a method. Suppose you want to simulate a bad connection :</p>

<p>Here we are capturing the return value to use it later in the test. For this special purpose, RSpecProxies also provides 2 other helpers :</p>

<h2>Proxy chains</h2>

<p>RSpec mocks provides the <code>message_chain</code> feature to do build chains of stubs. RSpecProxy provides a very similar proxy chain concept. The main difference is that it creates proxies along the way, and not pure stubs. Pure stubs assume that you are mocking everything, but as our goal is to mock as little as possible, using proxies makes more sense.</p>

<p>When using a mockist approach, the message chain is a bad smell because it makes your tests very brittle by depending on a lot of implementation. In contrast, proxy chains are meant to be used where they are the simplest way to inject what you need, without creating havoc.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to display the progress of a very slow background task. You could mock a lot of your objects to have a fast test, of if you wanted to avoid all the bad side effects of mocking, you could run the background task in your test, and have a slow test &hellip; Or, you could use a chain of proxies :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here the simplest thing to do is just to override a small getter, because from a functionnal point of view, that&rsquo;s exactly what we want to test.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One or two weeks ago, I registered to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Paris-Ruby-Workshop/">Paris Ruby Workshop Meetup</a> and needed a Ruby env. I have been using <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> quite a lot to isolate my different dev envs from each other and from my main machine. As I&rsquo;ve been digging more into <a href="http://www.docker.com">Docker</a> lately, I thought I&rsquo;d simply use Docker and Docker Compose instead.</p>

<p>I turned out to be dead simple. All that is needed is a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to define the container, record the shared volume and set a bundle path inside it :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">volumes</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&#39;.:/usr/src/app&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Without the custom bundle path, bundled gems would be installed elsewhere in the container, and lost at every restart.</p>

<p>To use the Rubybox, just type <code>docker-compose run rubybox</code> and you&rsquo;ll get a shell from within your ruby machine, where you can do everything you want.</p>

<p>In fact, I found the thing so useful, that I created the <a href="https://github.com/philou/rubybox">Rubybox</a> git repo to simplify cloning and reusing. I&rsquo;ve already cloned it at least 3 times since then !</p>

<p>In <a href="https://management30.com">Management 3.0</a> terms, that&rsquo;s a <a href="https://management30.com/practice/value-stories/">culture book</a>. It&rsquo;s a great way to build and crystallize a culture, and it serves as a guide for newcomers, and can later serve as an hiring ad for your team or company.</p>

<p>The good thing about a culture book, is that you don&rsquo;t have to write it in one go. It&rsquo;s a living artifact anyway, so you&rsquo;d better not ! Our current culture book has emerged from a collection of pages in our wiki.</p>

<h2>It started as working agreements</h2>

<p>The first real contributions to our culture book (though we did not know it at the time) was spending some time in retrospectives to define and review our working and coding conventions.</p>

<p>When we started doing retrospectives, we had to discuss, agree and formalize the decisions we made about our way of working. We usually did a &lsquo;review how we work&rsquo; activity at the beginning the retros, spending 10 minutes to make sure we all understood and agreed on our current working conventions. If there was any disagreement or update required, we would discuss them during the retro, and at the end, add, remove or modify items from our agreement page.</p>

<h2>It continued as self-organization workshops</h2>

<p>After a while, we had built up a pretty extensive set of working and coding conventions. The team had already become quite productive, but to keep the momentum in the long run, we needed to increase self-organization. By reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jurgen-Appelo/e/B00460MCJM/ref=sr_tc_2_0?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;qid=1470715896&amp;sr=8-2-ent">Management 3.0 books</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Workout-Practices-Improve-Delight-Management-ebook/dp/B00N6REYKQ/ref=asap_bc?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8#navbar">Management Workout</a> (which has been re-edited as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Happiness-Games-Practices-Motivate/dp/1119268680/ref=asap_bc?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8">Managing for Happiness</a>) in particular, I found description about how to use a <a href="https://management30.com/practice/delegation-board/">delegation board</a> and <a href="https://management30.com/product/delegation-poker/">delegation pokers</a> to measure and formalize the current delegation level of a team.</p>

<p>We did this, and started a lot of self-organization workshops :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/">Stop feeling like a kid every time you ask a day off</a></li>
<li><a href="/scrum-teams-do-not-need-a-scrum-master/">Scrum Teams Do Not Need a Scrum Master</a></li>
<li><a href="/make-hiring-everyones-business/">Make hiring everyone&rsquo;s business</a></li>
<li><a href="/how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/">How to deal with the incentive system in an agile team ?</a></li>
<li><a href="/how-we-decentralized-our-companys-training-program/">How We Decentralized Our Company&rsquo;s Training Program</a></li>
</ul>


<p>After each of these workshops, we created a wiki page, explaining how we planned to handle the subject in the team.</p>

<h2>The book</h2>

<p>At that point, we had fairly extensive and formal descriptions of our working practices and conventions. By reading this set of pages, someone would get a pretty accurate grasp of our principles and values.</p>

<p>Wondering how we could write our own culture book, I had an &ldquo;Aha !&rdquo; moment and realized that all I had to do was to create a wiki page pointing to all our different agreement pages. This only took 5 minutes.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-08-08-how-to-grow-a-culture-book/content.jpg" title="The table of content of our culture book" ></p>

<p>At the moment, our culture book serves 3 purposes :</p>

<ul>
<li>documentation for the team members</li>
<li>guide for newcomers</li>
<li>description about how we work for people in the company who might want to move to our team</li>
</ul>


<p>Next step would be to add a dash of design, a few war stories, export it as a PDF, and use it outside to advertise the team and the company.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="../imgs/2016-08-02-when-the-boy-scout-rule-fails/boy-scout-rule.jpg" alt="An illustration of the boy scout rule" /><div class="image-credits"><a href="http://bit.ly/2osQoyg">Original Tweet</a> by Marteen van Leeuwen</div></p>

<p>Here goes the <a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule">boy scout rule</a> :</p>

<blockquote><p>Always check a module in cleaner than when you checked it out.</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, this alone does not guarantee to keep the technical debt under control. What can we do then ?</p>

<h2>Why the boy scout rule is not enough</h2>

<p>I can easily think of a few issues that are not covered by the boy scout rule.</p>

<h3>It only deals with local problems</h3>

<p>In it&rsquo;s statement, the boy scout rule is local and does not address large scale design or architecture issues. Applying the boy scout rule keeps files well written, using with clear and understandable code. From a larger perspective though, it does very little or slow improvement to the overall design.</p>

<p>These large scale refactorings are very difficult to deal with using the boy scout rule alone. It could be done but would require to share the refactoring goal with all the team, and then track its progress, while at the same time dealing with all the other subjects of the project. That&rsquo;s starting to sound like multitasking to me.</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s skill dependent</h3>

<p>Another point about the boy scout rule (and to be fair, about any refactoring technique) is that programmers will be able to clean the code only as much as their skills allow them to !</p>

<p>Imagine what would happen when a new master developer arrives in a team of juniors, he&rsquo;d spot a lot of technical debt and would suggest improvements and ways to clean the code. Code that was thought of as very clean would suddenly be downgraded to junk !</p>

<p>The point here is that the boy scout rule cannot guarantee that you have no technical debt, because you don&rsquo;t know how much you have !</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where the debt metaphor reaches its limits and flips to some productivity investment. By investing time to perform some newly discovered refactoring, you could get a productivity boost !</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470200818&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-08-02-when-the-boy-scout-rule-fails/ddd.jpg" title="The cover of &#34;Domain Driven Design&#34;" alt="The cover of &#34;Domain Driven Design&#34;"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470200818&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a>, Eric Evans calls this knowledge distillation. He means that little by little, the team gains better understanding of the domain, sometimes going through what he calls a &lsquo;breakthrough&rsquo;. These breakthroughs often promote existing code to technical debt &hellip;</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s context dependent</h3>

<p>Developers alone are not the only one responsible for creating technical debt. Changes to the environment also do.</p>

<p>For example, if the market conditions change, and that new expectations for the product are slowly becoming the norm, your old perfectly working system becomes legacy and technical debt. As an example, let&rsquo;s examine what happened to the capital markets software industry in response to the 2008 crisis.</p>

<ul>
<li>The sector became a lot more regulated</li>
<li>Risk control is moving from nightly batches to real time</li>
<li>The demand for complex (and risky) contracts decreased</li>
<li>As a consequence, trading on simpler contracts exploded</li>
</ul>


<p>All these elements combined invalidated existing architectures !</p>

<p>New technologies also create technical debt. Think the switch from mainframe to the web.</p>

<h2>What do we need then ?</h2>

<p>Should we stop using the boy scout rule ? Surely not, it would be a total non-sense. Submitting clean and readable code is a must.</p>

<p>But it is not enough. If you have spotted some large scale refactoring that could bring some improvement, we should do what a fund manager would do :</p>

<ol>
<li>Estimate the return on investment</li>
<li>If it is good enough, do it now</li>
</ol>


<p>Obviously, large refactorings should also be split into smaller <del>value adding</del> cost reducing items. But then what ?</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Software-Development-Simple-Valuable/dp/1941222374/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470290668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+nature+of+software+development">The Nature of Software Development</a> Ron Jefferies says that we need a unique value-based prioritization strategy for everything, including technical improvements. Once you&rsquo;ve got that, there&rsquo;s no sense in splitting and embedding your refactoring in other tasks, this will just increase your work in progress, reducing your throughput and cycle time.</p>

<p>Frankly, I think that&rsquo;s easier said than done. I can <em>think</em> of two ways :</p>

<ul>
<li>As Ron Jefferies tends to say, have a jelled-cross-functional team discuss and prioritize collectively</li>
<li>As <a href="http://reinertsenassociates.com/technical-debt-adding-math-metaphor/">Don Reintersen</a> advocates, use an <a href="/a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/">economical framework</a> to estimate the return on investment</li>
</ul>


<p>At least that&rsquo;s a starting point !</p>
