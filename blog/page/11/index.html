<time datetime="2016-07-04T03:55:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 4<span>th</span>, 2016</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have recently been playing with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> while starting <a href="https://github.com/philou/planning-poker">my new side project</a>. I&rsquo;ve fallen into a situation where my production container uses a value for an environment variable, but while developing, I&rsquo;ll need both a different default and the ability to override this value.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and found various references about how to deploy Rails app using Docker, but in the end, I decided to use <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> which handles a lot of ops for me. Rails uses the RAILS_ENV environment variable to know if it&rsquo;s going to run in development, test or production mode. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/ruby/">heroku/ruby</a> image sets <code>RAILS_ENV=production</code>, but we usually want to use <code>RAILS_ENV=development</code> locally. I could have overridden RAILS_ENV in a docker-compose.override.yml file, but that would prevent me from running my app in production locally.</p>

<h2>The trick</h2>

<p>I eventually fixed my issue with combination of 2 files.</p>

<h3>docker-compose.override.yml</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>.env</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">RAILS_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>development
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>The logs</h3>

<p>My app starts in development mode by default :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>philou@philou-UX31E:~/code/planning-poker<span class="nv">$ </span>docker-compose up web

</span><span class='line'>web_1               | Use Ctrl-C to stop

<p>But I can still override RAILS_ENV to test for example :</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>5 years ago, I started blogging. I started really casually, my posts were personal reminders and notes rather than real well thought of articles. Nevertheless, it did me great good :</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been invited to talk at Meetups</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve had the joy of seeing some articles being tweeted many times</li>
<li>I received interesting job offers from all over the world</li>
</ul>


<p>6 months ago, after reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467000033&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=soft+skills">Soft Skills: The software developer&rsquo;s life manual</a>, I set up the practice of writing at least one article per week, and here is my (very encouraging) graph of sessions since then:</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-06-27-5-years-of-blogging-about-software/analytics.jpg" alt="The steadily increase curve of the sessions on my blog per month" /></p>

<h1>Excuses Why Not To Blog</h1>

<p>Here is a collection of the (bad) excuses you&rsquo;ll often hear people say for not blogging :</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t know how to write &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Blogging regularly is actually a pretty good way to improve your writing skills. As usual, the key is to fake it until you make it.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m not into this social media stuff &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to share anything personal on your software blog. In the end, your blog is a professional tool.</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t have anything interesting to say &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>They are others in the same situation as you who would like to see more posts about the kind of uninteresting things you just discovered. Wouldn’t you have liked someone to have written the newby article about « how to do XXX » you just spent 3 days to crack ?</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t have the time &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Make it ! Time is never found, it is made. In the end, it’s just a matter of prioritization.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are other totally valid reasons why not to blog, but I&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;re able to recognize those.</p>

<h1>Why Would You Blog ?</h1>

<p>On the other side, if you jump into blogging, you can expect a lot of returns :</p>

<ul>
<li>First thing is that you&rsquo;ll obviously gain more visibility. I&rsquo;ve got readers from all over the world, and my articles are sometimes re-tweeted many times.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll improve your writing skills. Writing skills turn out to be unexpectedly important for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M">software writers</a> !</li>
<li>In order to lay down your ideas about something, you&rsquo;ll need to dig a bit more into. It is said to be the last step to learning.</li>
<li>It can act as a personal documentation. I used to write mine as a how-to notepad on which I could refer later on.</li>
<li>If you have a day job, you can re-post your articles there. You should gain extra visibility and expose the company to new ideas.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How to start</h1>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve decided that you want to blog, starting should not be an issue.</p>

<h2>Pick a platform</h2>

<p>There are a lot of blogging platforms out there. For programmers, I would recommend a few though :</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-06-27-5-years-of-blogging-about-software/platforms.jpg" alt="Logos of my recommended blogging platforms" /></p>

<tr>

<td> Free, no setup, good looking, simple to use </td>

<td> Looks like a hosted version of Octopress, without the hassle ! </td>
<td> 50$/year</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Then, it&rsquo;s up to you !</p>

<h2>Start with how-to articles</h2>

<p>When I started my blog, it was mostly has a personal how-to reference. It allowed me to come back to it and find out how I did something last time. I thought that if it was important to me, it must be important to others as-well !</p>

<h2>Blog regularly</h2>

<p>Blogging every week made a huge difference to me. My traffic went from erratic to steadily increasing. I am currently observing a 11% traffic increase per month. This means that it nearly quadruples every year : I&rsquo;m not going to stop now !</p>

<h2>Integrate with the web</h2>

<p>This boils down to social networks and analytics. Obviously, you&rsquo;ll want to use Google Analytics to see how people are reading your content. I&rsquo;m using the venerable <a href="https://feedburner.google.com">Feedburner</a> to automatically post my new articles on <a href="https://twitter.com">twitter</a>. There&rsquo;s an option to use your post categories as hashtags, be sure to make it works, it brings a lot of traffic.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all up to you now !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The CFO&rsquo;s debt is visible in his balance sheet. The CTO&rsquo;s technical debt is invisible. What about making it visible ?</p>

<p>Developers have an intuitive sense of the technical debt in some parts of the system. But few have an accurate estimation of its full extent. Even the size of a code base is difficult to grasp. In the same way, the size of the code is just a number. But the fact are there : between 10 000 and 10 000 000 lines of code, the rules aren&rsquo;t the same, but it&rsquo;s only invisible data on hard drives &hellip;</p>

<h2>Showing It</h2>

<p>If we had a device or a trick to show to non-developers the size of the source code, people might start to feel the embarrassment of working in a bloated code base. Unfortunately, for the moment, the only ideas I had are somehow unrealistic, albeit funny !</p>

<h3>First Idea : Printouts</h3>

<p>Suppose we printed all the source code every Monday, and then keep it around for everyone to feel its size. We could leave it in the middle of the place, or in the CTO&rsquo;s office, so that he&rsquo;d actually be hindered by the space loss. The larger the code, the bigger the troubles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to print 50 lines on a sheet of paper, that&rsquo;s 100 on both sides.
That&rsquo;s 50 000 in a pack of 500 pages. And eventually, 200 000 in this kind of standard case :</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-06-08-the-size-of-code/paper-case.jpg" alt="A 2000 sheets paper case" /></p>

<p>Keeping these printouts in sync with the real cost would make the thing even more <del>painful</del> realistic. Imagine all the printings costs, and moving around cases of paper every day &hellip; ;)</p>

<h3>Second Idea : Inflatable Device</h3>

<p>What about an inflatable device linked to <a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> (or any other code metrics tracking system) ? It could grow as new code is written. We could make it as large as we want : 1m<sup>3</sup> for every 10K lines of Code, making the whole office a difficult place to walk around. Try to figure out how to work with this thing in the office :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jimmykuehnle.com/artblog/inflatable-bigger-than-the-studio/"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-06-08-the-size-of-code/Large_Inflatable_Art.jpg" alt="Large Inflatable Art (Jimmy Kuehnle)" /></a><div class="image-credits"><a href="http://www.jimmykuehnle.com/artblog/inflatable-bigger-than-the-studio/">By Jimmy Kuehnle</a> </div></p>

<h3>Third Idea : Sand</h3>

<p>For maximum pain, let&rsquo;s use real sand instead of an inflatable device ! Imagine the mess with some sand lying around in the office. If the only way to clean up the mess was to clean up the code, surely everyone would take the issue seriously !</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-06-08-the-size-of-code/sand-pile.jpg" alt="A sand pile on the pavement" /></p>

<h2>Final Word</h2>

<p>Obviously, these are jokes, but I guess there&rsquo;s a real need there. If we managed to make non developers feel the size and cost of the code base, it would be easier to agree on priorities.</p>

<p>Some days, coding feels like speleology or mining &hellip; Dealing with weird and undocumented old logic can even some time be <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-keep-your-sanity-while-working-on-a-Super-Dirty-Rotten-Spaghetti-codebase">damaging to the mind</a> ! I think we should go to work wearing the adequate protection !</p>

<p>OK, maybe we cannot start to go to work wearing a coverall everyday, but let&rsquo;s say very 21st of June is now legacy code day, the day when every developer maintaining legacy code comes to work dressed like that !</p>

<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s a joke, but it could attract the attention of other non-coding people on the state of <em>their</em> codebase and amount of <em>their</em> technical debt.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</a> Zaphod Beeblebrox has some anti panic glasses. They feature some special danger detection mechanism that turns them opaque black to save their bearer from panicking.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-06-02-anti-ugly-code-glasses/zaphod.jpg" alt="Zaphod Beeblebrox" /></p>

<p><em>(It turns out that Zaphod has two heads &hellip;)</em></p>

<p>In 2016, it&rsquo;s shocking that some many hours are lost by poor developers reading ugly code.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s build anti ugly-code glasses ! We&rsquo;d just need an IDE or editor plugin, connect it to <a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">Sonar</a> in order to get the quality of the current file, and if too bad, shut the glasses black !</p>

<p>Finally the killer feature for augmented reality glasses !</p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

<p>At the same time I started to program all day long for my living, I also started to read a lot of programming books on my spare time. This allowed me to learn at night and practice at day, setting everything in my brain.</p>

<p>This might come as a surprise, but I never read a lot of books about the technologies I was using. I&rsquo;d rather study fundamental programming books. These contain a lot of transportable knowledge, unlike in most books about a particular technology.</p>

<p>I believe this is a pretty good use of time since it made me a better programmer and also greatly reduced the time I need to master most new technologies. I can now easily relate them to some more general concept I learned before.</p>

<p>For example, I never read a book about UI. By the time I had to do some UI programming, I had absolutely no issue getting up to speed on the topic. I had already seen quite some UI code examples in other books, I knew that most UI frameworks are built from a set of Object Oriented patterns. Coming from a different perspective, I was even able to suggest improvements to the code that UI experts had not thought of.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that I never read books about a particular technology, sometimes, that&rsquo;s just what you need to start something new. But when I do, I usually find them quite easy to read and digest. And I tend to skip things I intuitively understand and use them as cookbooks containing recipes for particular problems rather than end to end walk-through.</p>

<p>As a young programmer this book made me understand that my job was not only about writing code, but about building maintainable systems. It provided me with tools to do so, 10 years later, I can still remember &ldquo;The power of plain text&rdquo;. This is also the book that made me have a first look into Ruby :).</p>

<p>Here is the theory behind all automated IDE refactorings. Reading this book had a profound influence on my coding style.

<p>With around 250 pages, it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to find a programming book with a greater value/page ratio. This one will teach you all there is to learn about C, and help you understand everything that was built on top of C (and that&rsquo;s quite a lot &hellip;)</p>

<p>Compared to C, Lisp is at the other side of the language spectrum. Learning C and Lisp gives the ability to put nearly anything in contrast to these 2 languages. Lisp is dynamic, functional and meta. It can be morphed into nearly anything and SICP teaches how to do so. There&rsquo;s a Lisp practice that is invaluable to any programmer : use your language to express your problem as simply as possible. SICP teaches that.</p>

<p>Neither the C book nor SICP deals with distribution and concurrency. That&rsquo;s what this book does. I had never programmed distributed systems before reading this book. After I read it, I learned how to code for distribution in a maintainable way. The lessons taught by Erlang are applicable in many languages.</p>

<h2>Not the best books</h2>

<p>I did not and will never read all programming books available. There might be newer books that treat the same subjects better, but these books are the ones that taught me the most about our craft. My point is that learning fundamentals and things far away from our daily technologies will teach us more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With time, I discovered a way of explaining the subtleties of my developer job to my uninformed relatives and friends.</p>

<p>Sharing what your developer job is about with others can be very frustrating. Some people think you are &ldquo;Just playing around with computers&rdquo; as if it was not serious work. Others think that it is an extremely Cartesian and solitary activity with no place for communication or creativity. Trying to explain the diversity and richness of a developer&rsquo;s work is often a disappointing experience.</p>

<h2>The book metaphor</h2>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-23-software-is-like-writing-and-revising-a-giant-book/book.jpg" alt="An old book" /></p>

<p>I explain to people that writing software is not unlike writing a huge book. A book long many millions of lines. I explain that the challenge is to maintain the whole story of the book coherent. I stress how difficult this is given that no one can take the time to read the full book, that the authors come and go, and that the book is under constant heavy revision.</p>

<h2>Details of our work</h2>

<p>The metaphor is quite valid and even holds about more subtle aspects of our work. Here is a summary of the last discussion I had about the book metaphor :</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>(Him) Do you have some &lsquo;gatekeepers&rsquo; for different sections of the story to make sure that these parts remain coherent ?</li>
<li>(Me) That&rsquo;s what we would call strong code ownership, this was the norm 20 years ago, but that the industry is moving to more collective code ownership, in order to decrease the bus factor.</li>
<li>(Him) What is the bus factor ?</li>
<li>(Me) The number of person who need to be hit by a bus to block your development progress</li>
<li>(Him) I see, that&rsquo;s kind of funny. But then, does that mean that any developer can change any part of the code ? Isn&rsquo;t that dangerous ?</li>
<li>(Me) Sure that would be difficult, that&rsquo;s not really how we do it. We make a lot of efforts to split the big story in many smaller independent ones as much as possible. This way, teams specialize on different &lsquo;chapters&rsquo; and work collectively within it.</li>
<li>(Him) I see</li>
<li>(Me) And if you need to change something in another &lsquo;chapter&rsquo; you should ask the guys who know it better to help you.</li>
<li>(Him) That makes sense. And what happens if two developers want to modify the same part of the story at the same time</li>
<li>(Me) That can happen. People might even want to modify the story in conflicting ways ! We&rsquo;ve got tools, processes and best practices to minimize this. If nothing is done, we&rsquo;ll get what we call a &lsquo;merge conflict&rsquo;.</li>
<li>(Him) Ho &hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed, but it seems collaboration is really important in your work, isn&rsquo;t it ?</li>
<li>(Me) Sure it is !</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>We are software writers</h2>

<p>All this reminds me of DHH&rsquo;s talk about writing software :</p>

<p>I had been switching to <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> in <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to host my Octopress installation, but that did not seem related &hellip;</p>

<h2>Plan A : Upgrade Octopress</h2>

<p>It turned out it was related to my migration to Vagrant and Docker.xs This kind of nasty error often comes from obsolete environment. <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1173">Internet confirmed</a> confirmed it :</p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu now uses Python3 instead of Python2</li>
<li>Octopress2 uses an old version of Pygments</li>
<li>That version of Pygments requires Python2</li>
</ul>


<p>I thought that I did not want to play <a href="/ruby-thirdparties-best-practices/">this game</a> against open source libs, so I set out to update. Octopress 3 has been released. It&rsquo;s not yet documented yet, and there is no official upgrade guide, but some guys have done it :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://samwize.com/2015/09/30/migrating-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/">http://samwize.com/2015/09/30/migrating-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dgmstuart.github.io/blog/2016/01/22/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-3/">http://dgmstuart.github.io/blog/2016/01/22/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-3/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.justinrummel.com/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/">https://www.justinrummel.com/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I tried it &hellip; but I stopped before the end. It&rsquo;s kind of working, but fundamental features like category archives required too much Jekylling for me at the time. And themes are still an issue &hellip; I mean, stock theme uses a clean and simple gem based update workflow, but most other themes rely on a tricky git clone-merge update workflow.</p>

<h2>Plan B : Find a hosted blog engine for hackers</h2>

<p>I found quite a few options :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> Looks cool, but there is no simple migration tool, and I&rsquo;ve been burned by postero.us shutting down, I want to keep control on my content</li>
<li><a href="https://posthaven.com/">Posthaven</a> Having loved postero.us, this one seems cool, It&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;m not sure the guys are keeping the motivation to increase their feature list with their current business model</li>
<li><a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> Looked great, but too expensive for me (19$ per month)</li>
<li><a href="http://codrspace.com">Codrspace</a> This is a special blogging platform for coders, but it seems it has not been updated for a long time</li>
<li><a href="https://logdown.com/">LogDown</a> This also is a special blogging platform for hackers. It seemed great and had everything I was looking for &hellip; I was ready to spend the 50$ per year for it as it could save me a lot of hassle. Unfortunately, I could not find a way to forward the categories of a post as <a href="https://twitter.com/pbourgau">Twitter</a> hashtags as I&rsquo;ve been doing with Octopress and <a href="https://feedburner.google.com">Feedburner</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In the end, I was rather disappointed by the alternatives, even though I was ready to pay for them.</p>

<h2>Plan C : Fix the error in Octopress 2</h2>

<p>Eventually, the fix was rather easy. People had fixed it by patching mentos.py file in the pygments.rb gem to run Python 2 instead of the stock Python. That&rsquo;s not great because it means that I&rsquo;d have to redo the patch every time I updated my gems, or rebuilt my workspace. Here is what I added to my Vagrantfile instead :</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get -y install python2.7
</span><span class='line'>sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://github.com/philou/philou.github.com/commit/ae14c511b682295ed7fdcb3b1a818926f803dd3a">Here</a> is the commit on my Github repo.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m sticking with Octopress2 for the moment. Maybe I&rsquo;ll re-try to migrate to Octopress3 later on, when an official migration tool or <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">guide</a> is available. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m still dreaming of my perfect blogging platform :</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>Static HTML generation</li>
<li>Self or SAAS hosted</li>
<li>Great integration with social media and the web</li>
<li>Easy to maintain</li>
<li>Plugable themes</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m looking for my next side project at the moment, that could be a useful one ! Anyone interested ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are a developer and you are not shipping, you&rsquo;re in the danger zone. I believe it&rsquo;s mostly your fault, and it&rsquo;s time to act.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-11-real-developers-ship/deliver.jpg" alt="A delivery key on a keyboard" /></p>

<h2>Nothing new</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s been told before. Famous blogs have said the same thing :</p>

<ul>
<li>In Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=290121">Real Programmers ship</a> without any explanation, as if it meant it all.</li>
<li>In Coding Horror <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway/">Version 1 Sucks, But Ship It Anyway</a> Jeff Atwood stresses the benefits of shipping early.</li>
<li>In Coding Horror again <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/shipping-isnt-enough/">Shipping Is Not Enough</a> Jeff Atwood goes one step further and explains that we need to create software that is going to be used.</li>
<li>In his <a href="http://removingalldoubt.com/post/2006/09/19/Fatherly-Advice-To-New-Programmers.aspx">fatherly advice to new programmers</a> Chuck Jazdzewski&rsquo;s says &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get paid to program, you get paid to ship.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<h2>What does it really mean ?</h2>

<p>If you are not shipping, are you really developing something ? Maybe it&rsquo;s more some kind of research project, or maybe you are just there for learning ? <em>Real Developers know what they are in for.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because the quality is too bad, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve been developing poor quality software &hellip; <em>Real developers write quality software.</em> (BTW, shipping bug fixes is not shipping)</p>

<p>If you are not shipping because you don&rsquo;t have yet enough features, that&rsquo;s because your MVP is not small enough (despite the current Skateboard metaphor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgETWBKCRSQ">this</a> is not an MVP). <em>So Real developers follow lean (startup) principles.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because it&rsquo;s much work, that&rsquo;s because you did not automate delivery. <em>Real developers use continuous delivery.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because someone else said so, maybe it&rsquo;s time to convince her. <em>Real developers know how to deal with people.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because you are in a shitty environment &hellip; <em>Real developers work on their skills to be able to quit when needed.</em></p>

<h2>Shipping above all else</h2>

<p>My point is that every developer or organization containing developers should put shipping value as their absolute priority, and things should get a lot simpler.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re doing pair programming almost all the the time in our team. A few weeks ago, we went to <a href="http://www.devoxx.fr/">Devoxx</a> Paris, and 2 team mates used pair programming at a hands on session : they finished way before the others and had the time to take a 30 minute break. Pair programming delivers more &hellip; when it works.</p>

<h2>Flavors of Pair Programming</h2>

<p>Throughout our experience, we have identified some situations where it does or does not work :</p>

<h2>The Pain Zone</h2>

<p>Pair programming can be painful. It can feel like a waste of time or extremely frustrating. Here are the typical situations and how to fix them.</p>

<h3>The Wandering Buddies</h3>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/going_nowhere.jpg" alt="A 'going nowhere' sign" /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d get if you asked to newcomers straight out of school to pair program on existing source code on day 1. They&rsquo;d be dabbling here and there, without going anywhere. Each one would try to get the keyboard to try his way, but in the end, no general direction would be followed.</p>

<p>The cure in this case (as often) is to stop and think. At least one in the pair needs to lean how to pair program. It&rsquo;s not difficult, that&rsquo;s just :</p>

<ul>
<li>Discuss and agree on a general plan first</li>
<li>Keep a todo list</li>
<li>Track your advancement on your todo list while you don&rsquo;t have the keyboard</li>
<li>Stop and discuss from time to time</li>
</ul>


<p>By starting that, the pair will quickly move into the &lsquo;mates&rsquo; state.</p>

<h3>The Export / The Novice</h3>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/race.jpg" alt="A race where Usain Bolt leave everyone meters behind" /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when a &lsquo;lone wolf kind of&rsquo; expert pairs with a junior. The expert picks the keyboard, dashes through the tasks, doesn&rsquo;t make sure his pair follows (which usually means it does not).</p>

<p>Regular pair programming means a change in job responsibilities for such expert programmers. If they were expert doers before, they should now become expert mentors or coaches. That&rsquo;s quite a difference. To them, it means that their goal must be to make his pair finish the task &hellip; It can be very frustrating at first. Nevertheless, the overall skill level in teams doing that increases so fast that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very fulfilling for the team as a whole.</p>

<h2>The Skill Zone</h2>

<p>The is where we want to be. When it happens, pair programming feels productive, interesting and fulfilling. Contrary to what is often thought, this can happen whatever the skill levels of the 2 programmers.</p>

<h3>The Mates</h3>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/to-do-list.jpg" alt="A Todo list" /></p>

<p>The programmers have equivalent skills on the subject at hand. They organized in a way that they are both learning from each other. By having to verbalize what and why they are doing things, by challenging each others assumptions and by sometimes doing differently than what they&rsquo;d alone.</p>

<h3>The Mentor &amp; The Apprentice</h3>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/help.jpg" alt="People helping each other to climb a mountain" /></p>

<p>Other times, there can be a real difference in skills for what the pair is attempting to do. In this situation, the goal of the most knowledgeable is to train his pair, who&rsquo;s goal is to learn. The task becomes some kind of exercise on which to practice.</p>

<p>During a typical pairing session, a pair might switch many times between mentor and mates states. Each one in the pair might assume the mentor&rsquo;s role for different aspect of the work. At the end of the day, everyone should feel as if they had learned and accomplished good work.</p>

<h2>Last Word of Caution</h2>

<p>Pair programming is exhausting. Don&rsquo;t expect to be able to do 40 hours of pair programming per week. After 6 hours in a day, one usually starts to get a lot less efficient.</p>

<p>Both juniors and experienced programmers also need some time by their own, to experiment things by themselves or to complete a simple task without having worry about explaining everything.</p>

<p>These are the reasons why <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</a> stresses having a sustainable pace and leaving space for <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack time</a></p>
