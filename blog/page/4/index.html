  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are a developer and you are not shipping, you&rsquo;re in the danger zone. I believe it&rsquo;s mostly your fault, and it&rsquo;s time to act.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-11-real-developers-ship/deliver.jpg" title="A delivery key on a keyboard" ></p>

<h2>Nothing new</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s been told before. Famous blogs have said the same thing :</p>

<ul>
<li>In Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=290121">Real Programmers ship</a> without any explanation, as if it meant it all.</li>
<li>In Coding Horror <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway/">Version 1 Sucks, But Ship It Anyway</a> Jeff Atwood stresses the benefits of shipping early.</li>
<li>In Coding Horror again <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/shipping-isnt-enough/">Shipping Is Not Enough</a> Jeff Atwood goes one step further and explains that we need to create software that is going to be used.</li>
<li>In his <a href="http://removingalldoubt.com/post/2006/09/19/Fatherly-Advice-To-New-Programmers.aspx">fatherly advice to new programmers</a> Chuck Jazdzewski&rsquo;s says &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get paid to program, you get paid to ship.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<h2>What does it really mean ?</h2>

<p>If you are not shipping, are you really developing something ? Maybe it&rsquo;s more some kind of research project, or maybe you are just there for learning ? <em>Real Developers know what they are in for.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because the quality is too bad, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve been developing poor quality software &hellip; <em>Real developers write quality software.</em> (BTW, shipping bug fixes is not shipping)</p>

<p>If you are not shipping because you don&rsquo;t have yet enough features, that&rsquo;s because your MVP is not small enough (despite the current Skateboard metaphor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgETWBKCRSQ">this</a> is not an MVP). <em>So Real developers follow lean (startup) principles.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because it&rsquo;s much work, that&rsquo;s because you did not automate delivery. <em>Real developers use continuous delivery.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because someone else said so, maybe it&rsquo;s time to convince her. <em>Real developers know how to deal with people.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because you are in a shitty environment &hellip; <em>Real developers work on their skills to be able to quit when needed.</em></p>

<h2>Shipping above all else</h2>

<p>My point is that every developer or organization containing developers should put shipping value as their absolute priority, and things should get a lot simpler.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re doing pair programming almost all the the time in our team. A few weeks ago, we went to <a href="http://www.devoxx.fr/">Devoxx</a> Paris, and 2 team mates used pair programming at a hands on session : they finished way before the others and had the time to take a 30 minute break. Pair programming delivers more &hellip; when it works.</p>

<h2>Flavors of Pair Programming</h2>

<p>Throughout our experience, we have identified some situations where it does or does not work :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Pain Zone         </th>
<th> Skill Zone</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Wandering buddies </td>
<td> Mates</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expert / Novice   </td>
<td> Mentor &amp; Apprentice</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br>


<h2>The Pain Zone</h2>

<p>Pair programming can be painful. It can feel like a waste of time or extremely frustrating. Here are the typical situations and how to fix them.</p>

<h3>The Wandering Buddies</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/going_nowhere.jpg" title="A 'going nowhere' sign" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d get if you asked to newcomers straight out of school to pair program on existing source code on day 1. They&rsquo;d be dabbling here and there, without going anywhere. Each one would try to get the keyboard to try his way, but in the end, no general direction would be followed.</p>

<p>The cure in this case (as often) is to stop and think. At least one in the pair needs to lean how to pair program. It&rsquo;s not difficult, that&rsquo;s just :</p>

<ul>
<li>Discuss and agree on a general plan first</li>
<li>Keep a todo list</li>
<li>Track your advancement on your todo list while you don&rsquo;t have the keyboard</li>
<li>Stop and discuss from time to time</li>
</ul>


<p>By starting that, the pair will quickly move into the &lsquo;mates&rsquo; state.</p>

<h3>The Export / The Novice</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/race.jpg" title="A race where Usain Bolt leave everyone meters behind" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when a &lsquo;lone wolf kind of&rsquo; expert pairs with a junior. The expert picks the keyboard, dashes through the tasks, doesn&rsquo;t make sure his pair follows (which usually means it does not).</p>

<p>Regular pair programming means a change in job responsibilities for such expert programmers. If they were expert doers before, they should now become expert mentors or coaches. That&rsquo;s quite a difference. To them, it means that their goal must be to make his pair finish the task &hellip; It can be very frustrating at first. Nevertheless, the overall skill level in teams doing that increases so fast that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very fulfilling for the team as a whole.</p>

<h2>The Skill Zone</h2>

<p>The is where we want to be. When it happens, pair programming feels productive, interesting and fulfilling. Contrary to what is often thought, this can happen whatever the skill levels of the 2 programmers.</p>

<h3>The Mates</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/to-do-list.jpg" title="A Todo list" ></p>

<p>The programmers have equivalent skills on the subject at hand. They organized in a way that they are both learning from each other. By having to verbalize what and why they are doing things, by challenging each others assumptions and by sometimes doing differently than what they&rsquo;d alone.</p>

<h3>The Mentor &amp; The Apprentice</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/help.jpg" title="People helping each other to climb a mountain" ></p>

<p>Other times, there can be a real difference in skills for what the pair is attempting to do. In this situation, the goal of the most knowledgeable is to train his pair, who&rsquo;s goal is to learn. The task becomes some kind of exercise on which to practice.</p>

<p>During a typical pairing session, a pair might switch many times between mentor and mates states. Each one in the pair might assume the mentor&rsquo;s role for different aspect of the work. At the end of the day, everyone should feel as if they had learned and accomplished good work.</p>

<h2>Last Word of Caution</h2>

<p>Pair programming is exhausting. Don&rsquo;t expect to be able to do 40 hours of pair programming per week. After 6 hours in a day, one usually starts to get a lot less efficient.</p>

<p>Both juniors and experienced programmers also need some time by their own, to experiment things by themselves or to complete a simple task without having worry about explaining everything.</p>

<p>These are the reasons why <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</a> stresses having a sustainable pace and leaving space for <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack time</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In french, we say &ldquo;Le cordonnier est toujours le plus mal chaussé&rdquo; which I found an English equivalent in &ldquo;the shoemaker’s son always goes barefoot&rdquo;. I believe this is nowhere more true than in the software industry !</p>

<p>&ldquo;Software is eating the world&rdquo; they say. Software is now able to do things that only humans used to be. So why the hell are we driving our projects as if we were a horde of amateur hitch hikers ?</p>

<h2>What does it mean to be data driven ?</h2>

<p>Being data driven would allow us to answer questions such as :</p>

<ul>
<li>How much is the feature we delivered last week contributing to the bottom line ?</li>
<li>How much is the feature we are currently developing expected to contribute to the bottom line ?</li>
<li>What are the estimated cost <em>and value</em> of increasing our test coverage of 1% ?</li>
<li>What are the estimated interests and nominal amounts of our current technical debt ?</li>
<li>Which is the most valuable : improving our build system or building this new feature ?</li>
</ul>


<p>Most projects I&rsquo;ve worked in have absolutely no clue about the answers to these questions. The decision is left to experts, to the one with most influence, or simply to the developer, who can do how he thinks is best &hellip;</p>

<h2>The books</h2>

<p>Hopefully, some people are thinking differently, they believe it is possible to quantify all this, they even explain how !</p>

<p>Although this book is getting old, and is a bit outdated when compared to agile development practices, it provides real world examples of how scientific measurement can be applied to software product development.</p>

<h2>An opportunity</h2>

<p>Reading these books was a real eye opener for me. The software development world is plagued with cargo cult and supposed best practices. We follow advises, but most often without verifying if they actually work ! I believe that by applying the techniques in these books, we could create standard ways to measure the values of productivity, technical debt, quality, testing &hellip;</p>

<p>I see real opportunities to avoid a lot of useless argument between proponents of A and B, but also to communicate better with all stakeholders and finally, to reduce stress for all of us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day, neither will be your Lego Office &hellip; This week is Devoxx in Paris, for the occasion, we decided to stream a <a href="/recipes-for-an-agile-workspace/">Lego office</a> experiment that my team did.</p>

<h2>What are Lego Offices</h2>

<p>I wrote about Lego office in a previous post, as a concept and a set of material that would allow teams to easily configure their workspaces as they wish. At that time, I thought of :</p>

<ul>
<li>laptops</li>
<li>extra monitors</li>
<li>tables and chairs on wheels</li>
<li>movable walls</li>
<li>movable white boards</li>
<li>movable wall screens</li>
<li>a good Wifi</li>
</ul>


<h2>Our experiment</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/empty-meeting-area.jpg" title="Meeting area in the empty office" >
<img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/empty-work-area.jpg" title="Work area in the empty office" ></p>

<p>The last floor of our building in Paris has a nice (really) open space area with rolling tables that we could use. We moved all the team there for one week. As we don&rsquo;t have laptops with Wifi, we simply asked for enough power and network plugs.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/setup-work-area.jpg" title="Setup work area" >
<img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/setup-meeting-area.jpg" title="Setup meeting area" >
<img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/setup-rest-area.jpg" title="Setup rest area" ></p>

<p>The place is large enough to have dedicated rest and meeting space. We managed to create a visio setup using our build monitor. We even had a remote lunch once, which we should repeat more often !</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s missing</h2>

<p>Obviously, this was a quick experiment, nothing like a fully architectured Lego workspace, still it helped us to discover issues and blocking points. It turns out that cables <em>are</em> an issue !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/cables.jpg" title="Cables on the floor" ></p>

<p>After getting some feedback throughout the company, it turns out that some developers would never trade their high end connected desktop workstation for a Wifi laptop. Our C++ build can be pretty CPU and network intensive &hellip; I guess that means that a real Lego office might require one of the following :</p>

<ul>
<li>A technical floor with all the place required to bring any kind of cables to your machine</li>
<li>Powerful servers in a data center to do the grunt work for you</li>
<li>Single cable machines (Apple&rsquo;s USB-C is the only one I can think of right now)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Last minute question</h2>

<p>Thinking of it &hellip; could different remote offices such as your home, or a co-working space be considered as Lego blocks ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe your company too has a development program you can use to track and organize your training path. That&rsquo;s already great ! It is often not perfect though. Sometimes, the initiative in itself can feel like an afterthought. Some other times, the process is completely left to the employee and his manager, with varying results, from great to forced upon everyone.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-18-how-we-decentralized-our-companys-training-program/learning.jpg" title="A 'learning' word cloud" ></p>

<h2>How did we rebuild this program in our team</h2>

<p>As you might remember if you read my <a href="/blog/categories/selforganizing/">previous posts</a>, we started a self organization initiative using a <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board</a>. When we tried to decentralize <a href="/how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/">the end of year evaluation</a>, we started discussing the subjects of personal development. We decided to have a dedicated workshop about this subject</p>

<h2>Guiding principles</h2>

<p>In our company, the development program allows a manager to assign specific learning goals to his collaborators, and anyone can also create his own goals to justify going to specific trainings. Starting from that, we agreed that the development program should be used to help anyone in the team to improve skills that are interesting for both the company and the employee. If the employee is interested in something completely unrelated to work, then he should obviously tackle that in his own time. If the company needs its employee to acquire some immediate mandatory skills, then that should be part of the daily job and subject to the end of year evaluation.</p>

<p>The idea is to try to find a win-win combinations, were employees are motivated to work their best at a company that they know helps them to full-fill their long term goals.</p>

<h2>What did we came us with ?</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-04-18-how-we-decentralized-our-companys-training-program/mentor-mentee.jpg" title="A lion and a lion cub side by side" ></p>

<p>This workshop was quite effective :</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, everyone is responsible for his own development, it&rsquo;s a chance offered by the company. It cannot be forced unto people.</li>
<li>It is based on volunteer mentorship : everyone should have regular meetings with his mentor to asses his progress on his long term goal, to try to get feedback and ideas about how to move forward. We started by saying that the team leader is the default mentor, but anyone can find another mentor at any moment.</li>
<li>The process starts with the search for a long term goal. Examples are &ldquo;I want to be an agile coach&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I want to be a performance expert&rdquo;</li>
<li>With the help of the mentor if needed, the long term goal should be split in yearly objectives and tracked using <a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/HenrikJanVanderPol/how-to-outperform-anyone-else-introduction-to-okr">OKRs</a></li>
<li>Everyone is free to track his progress has he wishes. Visual tracking makes the discussion with the mentor a lot easier. We have been looking at tools to track OKRs but it was surprisingly difficult to find one that suited our use. Most are enterprisy tools with manager-managee relationships. We just wanted simple personal tracking tools. For my part, I adapted a <a href="https://trello.com/b/MPM4rspd/okrs">Trello</a> board I found on the internet.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After doing a few months of this, I can say that this has a positive aspect on motivation, people told me that they felt more in control of their destiny. Something else I noted, is that junior developers need help and guidance. They often don&rsquo;t really know what they want to do in a few years, so they really need a mentor to help them find out the what and the how. The other side of this is that a team obviously needs senior developers to act as mentor &hellip; among other things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For an organization, there&rsquo;s something schizophrenic about valuing team work, wanting agility but sticking to individual objectives and assessments.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-03-30-how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/schizophrenic-smiley.jpg" title="A schizophrenic :(: smiley" ></p>

<p>As highlighted in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Built-Last-Successful-Visionary-Essentials/dp/0060516402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459922545&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=build+to+last">Build To Last</a> genuine company values must permeate all aspects of the organization. Being agile also means putting teamwork first and that is quite incompatible with typical individual management by objectives and bonuses.</p>

<p>This is nothing new, many have already written about the subject</p>

<ul>
<li>Joel Spolsky : <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000070.html">Incentive Pay Considered Harmful</a></li>
<li>Daniel Pink : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459665370&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=drive+daniel+pink">Drive : The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</a></li>
<li>Alfie Kohn : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punished-Rewards-Trouble-Incentive-Praise/dp/0618001816/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459665424&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=punished+by+rewards">Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A&rsquo;s, Praise, and Other Bribes</a></li>
<li>Jurgen Appelo : <a href="http://noop.nl/2013/01/the-bonus-system.html">The Bonus System</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The problem is you usually don&rsquo;t have the choice ! Whether your team wants to or not, the chances are that your company already has a mandatory individual bonus scheme in place.</p>

<h2>Our delegation initiative</h2>

<p>As you might remember if you read my <a href="/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/">previous articles</a>, our team decided to move to more self organization. After identifying the end of year evaluation as something that could be further delegated, we embarked on brainstorming sessions about how to do it.</p>

<p>We discussed quite some options during our workshops. Things like :</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the goal of the annual evaluation ?</li>
<li>Should some people have a central role in the process ?</li>
<li>Should we encourage efforts or results ?</li>
<li>Should evaluations be public or private ?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s at stack at the annual evaluation ?</li>
<li>Should individual learning plans be part of the evaluation ?</li>
</ul>


<h2>What we came up with</h2>

<p>As a guiding principle, we agreed to value efforts rather than results. Sometimes, results are independent of efforts, and through efforts, it is always possible to get the best of any situation, even if the best is not a good result in itself.</p>

<h3>Throughout the year</h3>

<p>We are all sharing the same team objectives :</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;the team finishes the prioritized epics&rdquo; : we do regular epics prioritization sessions with our product owner and add the main epics to everyone&rsquo;s objectives</li>
<li>&ldquo;work on the same subject as the whole team&rdquo; : we have an overspecialization matrix that uses correlation to make sure that everyone touches the same parts of the system as the rest of the team</li>
</ul>


<p>Every 2 months, we are doing <a href="/feedback-on-360-degrees-feedback-session/">360° feedback sessions</a>, for everyone to give continuous feedback to others.</p>

<p>Optionally, we setup <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/intrinsic-motivation/kudo-box/">Kudo boxes</a> to give and receive thanks from others.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-03-30-how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/kudo.jpg" title="A kudo card" ></p>

<h3>At the end of the year</h3>

<p>When the time of the official end of year evaluation comes, we do 360°, 1 to 1 rating on the following topics.</p>

<ul>
<li> commitment &amp; courage (doing not so fun work, find difficult compromises, say the truth, strive for quality work)</li>
<li> helping others (giving a training, providing coaching, help others, do some evangelization)</li>
<li> self improvement (taking feedback into account, improve technical skills, work on soft skills)</li>
<li> team player (build friendly environment, contribute to team improvement, positive attitude, use a non violent communication)</li>
</ul>


<p>Grades are signed, and anyone can ask someone else for a discussion about his grades.</p>

<p>Overall, everyone gets an average grade, which we use to suggest a company grade (below, achieved, exceeded) to the HR system. It then gets homogenized with the rest of the company, but this is then out of our control.</p>

<p>One thing that made this possible is also that after taking a close look at the company grade system, we saw that not so much was at stake &hellip; Provided we make sure everyone has what it takes to do the job, anyone can get an achieved evaluation by doing enough efforts. Getting an exceeded is like a bonus for a particular good year.</p>

<h2>Last word</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure we could make this more simple in an environment with more end to end feedback (start-up or pizza teams) but we feel that our current alternative is a lot better than having the manager deciding everything on his own.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me tell you a typical hiring story. A bit more than 10 years ago, I was contractor at a bank on a C++ front office application. The system had initially been well engineer, but it had been <del>stuffed together</del> merged with another system that had a completely different architecture. Ha, and there were no automated tests. As you&rsquo;d guess, we had quite our dose of bugs, and maintaining this application was not easy.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-03-21-make-hiring-everyones-business/now-hiring.jpg" title="A 'Now Hiring' sign" ></p>

<p>The manager wanted to hire a C++ programmer to beef up the team. Along with the division&rsquo;s architect he was conducting interviews to find just that guy. A few weeks later, he found a known C++ &amp; Windows local expert. A few weeks later, the team unanimously declared that we could not work with him because he was both pretentious and incompetent.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure every developer already witnessed a similar story.</p>

<h2>Managers do the hiring</h2>

<p>This is the usual practice. The motivation is that managers have more experience so they should be better at it, and also that it alleviates developers from non-programming work. As we saw in the introduction story, there are issues with this approach too :</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s pretty bad for the team &lsquo;fit&rsquo; : there is no team building here. You often end up with a collection of individual working at the same place rather than with a real team.</li>
<li>during these interviews, the candidate only interacts with a particular type of profiles, who can tell how he&rsquo;ll be doing with more junior team members for example ?</li>
<li>as usual, this administrative work removes some programming from the manager&rsquo;s time. That&rsquo;s often not a good bargain</li>
<li>it decreases the team sense of control, as it is being &lsquo;forced&rsquo; to work with someone they did not choose. This makes it harder for them to take responsibility of what they are trying to achieve.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How we self organized hiring</h2>

<p>As I already explained in a <a href="/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/">previous post</a> we engaged in various self delegation initiative by doing a <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board</a>. During this meeting, we identified hiring as something that could be self delegated.</p>

<p>In order to fix that, we started a workshop for 1 hour per day with a sub group of the team. We started with a brainstorming, then we voted, and finally presented our proposition to the rest of the team, which actually validated it. The whole thing lasted for one week (5 hours).</p>

<p><a href="http://dilbert.com"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-03-21-make-hiring-everyones-business/dilbert.jpg" title="A Dilbert cartoon about hiring based on internet profile" ></a></p>

<h2>What we decided for hiring</h2>

<p>Here is the process we have decided to follow to handle hiring team members</p>

<ol>
<li>First, everyone in the team is responsible to speak up when he thinks we need to hire someone, during our retrospectives for example</li>
<li>To handle new applications, we have prepared an online interview. It contains open questions and online coding exercises, on <a href="http://www.cyber-dojo.org/">cyber-dojo</a>, which allows us to track all the candidates iterations</li>
<li>We do a round robin to find out who will follow the candidate through the hiring process. This means taking notes, organizing interviews, keeping the rest of the team up to date.</li>
<li>When a candidate passes the online interview, we will receive him for an technical and general interview with 2 people from the team.</li>
<li>All the team will then meet the candidate for a coffee break, in order to know if he will fit in the team</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll then play the <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/6053596147744768/">Google hiring committee</a> until we reach a consensus</li>
<li>When in doubt, we&rsquo;ll do extra interviews, and repeat</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s just what we came up with, if you start this road, you might well come up with a very different process.</p>

<h2>One more thing</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to have a selective hiring, but you&rsquo;ll also need to improve the input of the hiring pipeline, but that&rsquo;s <a href="/great-developers-are-free/">another story</a> &hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We don&rsquo;t have an official scrum master in our team anymore. We now have 7 ! A different team member assumes the full scrum master role at every sprint.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-03-15-scrum-teams-do-not-need-a-scrum-master/round-robin.jpg" title="A fat round robin bird" ></p>

<h2>Why did we switch to Scrum Master round robin ?</h2>

<p>It all started with our <a href="https://management30.com/product/delegation-poker/">delegation poker</a> (see <a href="/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/">previous post</a>). We noticed that there were still quite some activities that I (the manager) was the only one to do. We hoped that by sharing these activities throughout the team, we would :</p>

<ul>
<li>increase everyone&rsquo;s motivation by showing a bigger picture</li>
<li>leave me more time for programming</li>
<li>learn new skills to everyone</li>
</ul>


<h2>How did we do it ?</h2>

<p>Before our <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board meeting</a>, we had prepared all the activities we are regularly doing. We found quite a few recurrent non programming tasks that traditionally eschewed to the team lead (me in that case). The initial plan was to find ways to delegate these activities to the team during the meeting, but it would have took way too much time.</p>

<p>Having identified all these activities, I individually suggested at everyone in the team to do a round robin scrum master role, which would handle all these activities for a sprint. I was happily surprise by the quasi complete buy-in from all the team. Before I announced it to the team, I did 2 things :</p>

<h3>List all the activities of the scrum master.</h3>

<p>Here is a subset :</p>

<ul>
<li>attend other teams meetings</li>
<li>make sure there are enough workable stories for the next planning session with the product owner</li>
<li>prepare and animate a retrospective</li>
<li>animate the demo</li>
</ul>


<h3>Make this more fun !</h3>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I bought totems for the scrum master. The team chose to keep Yoda in Paris and send Darth Vador in <a href="https://twitter.com/ahmadatwi">Ahmad</a> suitcase back in Beirut.</p>

<h2>What did we get ?</h2>

<p>After a few sprints of this, the feedback I got is that people like the increased involvement in the big picture (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458076848&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=daniel+pink+drive">Daniel Pink told us that already</a>). On my part, it allowed to increase my programming time to nearly 7 uninterrupted days per sprint (10 days). I&rsquo;m quite happy with this ! As for the third goal, learning new skills, I guess we&rsquo;ll need a bit more time to figure this out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most companies don&rsquo;t have <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/performance-management/">unlimited vacations</a>. Most likely, if you are an employee, your days off need to be validated by your boss. If you are like me, this feels like pulling teeth &hellip; Every time I have to ask for a day off, I feel like a kid asking for an extra candy</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not the only issue with how we traditionally deal with vacations :</p>

<ul>
<li>The boss has to make sure that there are always enough people at the office to handle emergencies</li>
<li>If the boss is himself away, getting a day off at the last moment becomes difficult</li>
</ul>


<h2>Our Delegation Board</h2>

<p>Our team at work is already rather agile : we&rsquo;re using a blend of XP and Scrumban, we follow solid engineering practices and we are always trying to improve to deliver more value to our users. After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Management-3-0-Developers-Developing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321712471/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457988177&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=management+3.0">Management 3.0</a> and <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/">Management Workouts</a> I was convinced that I needed to move the team towards even more self organization.</p>

<p>We started by doing <a href="https://management30.com/product/delegation-poker/">delegation poker</a>, we created a <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board</a>, and set out to move all cards we could to the right side of the board.</p>

<p><a href="/imgs/2016-03-12-stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/delegation-board-large.jpg"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-03-12-stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/delegation-board.jpg" title="Our trello delegation board" ></a></p>

<p>We spotted the following topics that could be more self organized</p>

<ul>
<li>vacations</li>
<li>hiring</li>
<li>business objectives and end of year evaluations</li>
<li>various recurring scrum related activities</li>
<li>self development objectives</li>
</ul>


<h2>Vacations</h2>

<p>We decided to tackle vacations first, because it seemed easy. We did a quick brainstorming, and here is what we came up with :</p>

<ul>
<li>We cannot change the company policy, so I&rsquo;ll still have to officially validate everyone&rsquo;s vacations in the system but &hellip;</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll validate anything asked !</li>
<li>Our internal system allows to check the other team member&rsquo;s vacations, so everyone in the team is responsible to check that there will always be at least 2 people at work before taking a day off</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="/imgs/2016-03-12-stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/mxopal.png"><img class="center" src="/imgs/2016-03-12-stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/mxopal.jpg" title="Screenshot of our vacation dashboard" ></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been 6 months, and it&rsquo;s been working like a charm. I think it made everything simpler once we had a clear rule about when vacations were OK or not.</p>
