    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/principles-that-will-make-you-become-a-badass-developer/">previous post</a> was about the badass developer attitude. More specifically, how it can buy sponsorship for large scale refactorings. Unfortunately, attitude is not enough. We also need to be able to deliver in a way that builds trust with the business. Most of all, business <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">is scared of the tunnel effect</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">Incremental software development</a> techniques allows to deliver large scale refactoring step by step. Not only that, but it also allows to do so alongside business features. That&rsquo;s how badass developers walk their talk and gain the business people&rsquo;s trust.</p>

<p>This is the fifth post in <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/large-scale-refactoring-sponsorship-series/">a series about how to get sponsorship for large scale refactoring</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, I encourage you to start from <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-07-20-incremental-software-development-techniques-for-large-scale-refactorings/incremental-plant.jpg" alt="Drawing of a plant at different stages of growth, illustrating Incremental Software Development" /></p>

<h2>Why do incremental software development matter ?</h2>

<h3>A short story</h3>

<p>A few years ago, I joined a team whose work involved a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain Specific Language</a> and a parser. The parser had grown in an ad-hoc way for a few years, and was now both very brittle and difficult to extend. We knew the way to go was to adopt a more solid parsing approach. We wanted to migrate to <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-pass_compiler">multi pass parser</a>.</p>

<p>As always, the business was very pushy for new features. There was no way we could have stoped everything for a full parser re-write. We explained to them that some of their features would be impossible to write without the new parser. We suggested that we work on migrating the parser as a background technical Epic. We did so using incremental software development techniques.</p>

<p>It took us a few months to migrate the parser. Meanwhile, we kept the software in a releasable state. This allowed us to validate our progress on the refactoring. We could continue to release features. We were able to share our progress on the refactoring with  the business people. They were very happy with the way we did this refactoring. In fact, it set a standard about how to prepare the software for big features later on.</p>

<h3>The real problems</h3>

<p>To understand why incremental software development works, let&rsquo;s understand the alternatives&#8217; problems. The main alternative it to do the refactoring in one massive task. This kind of initiative screams &ldquo;Tunnel effect waiting to happen&rdquo; ! The <a href="http://www.wethetalent.co/data-robots-ai/the-tunnel-effect-and-the-abstruse-trap/">tunnel effect</a> scares business people for 3 reasons :</p>

<ol>
<li>Because they don&rsquo;t know how much money they&rsquo;ll need to put in the tunnel to get out of it</li>
<li>Because they don&rsquo;t know when they&rsquo;ll get the other features which they are also waiting for</li>
<li>To be blocked in the tunnel if something unexpected and important comes along</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-07-20-incremental-software-development-techniques-for-large-scale-refactorings/tunnel-effect.jpg" alt="Picture of someone holding a light, alone in a tunnel. Incremental Software Development helps to avoid the tunnel effect when performing a large scale refactoring" /></p>

<p>Delivering a large scale refactoring with incremental software development fixes these 3 points.</p>

<ul>
<li>Every commit is a step forward while keeping the system in a releasable state. If ever something unexpected comes along, we can pause the refactoring for a while. (point 3)</li>
<li>Not all the team has to work on refactoring at the same time. Working on the refactoring does not block the delivery of other features. (point 2)</li>
<li>Finally, after working on a refactoring for a while, it becomes easier to have an idea of how long it will take. (point 1)</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 Incremental software development fixes the business people&rsquo;s fear of refactoring tunnel.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is true that performing the refactoring in one team-wide batch would be more efficient. It would reduce the overall Work In Progress and get it done quicker. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also a lot more scary for business people !</p>

<h2>Incremental Software Development techniques</h2>

<p>Like any skills, we can learn these techniques. Some are easy, and we can learn them from books. Others are more difficult and are usually learned through hard won experience. They can also be learned from a veteran developer in your team who&rsquo;s been through all this already. If you aren&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t have a veteran around, we can still manage. <a href="https://medium.com/the-crossover-cast/deliberate-practice-learn-like-an-expert-cc3114b8a10e">Deliberate practice</a> is a great way to <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-i-got-my-feet-wet-with-machine-learning-with-the-first-20-hours/">learn almost anything</a>. <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/coding-dojo/">Coding dojos</a> are the thing here (I&rsquo;ll write more about this later).</p>

<p>Once we master these skills, a lot of things change. First, we can do refactoring without harming our relationship with business people. Second, it builds enough self confidence among developers to negotiate with business people. This in itself, makes us more credible in their eyes. As a result, they are more likely to compromise on prioritizing refactoring.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Mastering incremental software development builds self-confidence for developers.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-mistakes-badass-developers-never-do/">last post</a>, I went over things we should avoid if we want to become badass developers. As I said though, this is far from enough. Once we&rsquo;ve stoped losing trust from the business, it&rsquo;s time to build some more ! This is the forth post in <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/large-scale-refactoring-sponsorship-series/">a series about how to get sponsorship for a large scale refactoring</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, start reading from <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>The badass developers gain the business&rsquo;s trust by sneaking in as business partners. A good way to become one is to start acting like one ! Here are examples of principles for that.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-07-09-principles-that-will-make-you-become-a-badass-developer/badass-principles-tatoo.jpg" alt="Arm of a badass developer with the tatoo '&gt; Badass Principles;' " /></p>

<h2>Keeping the business best interests in mind</h2>

<p>This is all about decision making. We should try to steer decisions according to the business. Whenever we talk with business people, we should stay aways from technical topics. I still remember my younger self explaining threading details to a trader &hellip; Most of all I remember the look on his face ! We should avoid technical bla bla, but we should be clear about the business consequences.</p>

<h2>Honesty and Candor</h2>

<p>When we don&rsquo;t agree with something, we should say so. When we don&rsquo;t understand something, we should ask the question. We need to stick to facts and assume everyone has the business&rsquo;s best interests in mind. Candor is a way to get our opinions and questions through, without sounding rude or pushy. There&rsquo;s a whole chapter about candor in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531133278&amp;sr=8-1">Creativity.inc</a>, the book about Pixar.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531133278&amp;sr=8-1"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-07-09-principles-that-will-make-you-become-a-badass-developer/creativity-inc.jpg" alt="Cover of the Creativity.inc book. It contains lessons on Candor we should all read to become badass developers" /></a></p>

<p>With time, business people will think of us as a positive and <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/real-developers-ship/">pragmatic problem solvers</a>. That is exactly the kind of people they want to work with !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Candor is a way to get our opinions and questions through, without sounding rude or pushy.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Strong opinions, but weekly held</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror">Jeff Atwood</a>, already <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">wrote</a> about this. The idea is to fight for our opinions, but let them go without a fuss when we proved wrong. We know that we are all very often wrong. Only fools or self-centered people don&rsquo;t admit this reality. Business people won&rsquo;t trust us in either case. We need to show that we can go over our previous opinions. This grows our reputation of rational problem solver.</p>

<h2>Acknowledging when we don&rsquo;t know</h2>

<p>The same logic goes with knowledge. None of us knows everything. We have to admit when we don&rsquo;t know something and ask for help. This proves that we place the business&rsquo;s speed over our personal &lsquo;know-it-all&rsquo; reputation.</p>

<p>Here is a story that happened to me at my first job. I&rsquo;m sure most developers go through it one day or another. I was assigned a new task involving technologies I did not know. I did not have the guts to state upfront that I would have to learn them. The result was that I sent 2 full weeks fiddling with this task to get something working. The more it went on, the more the product people were wondering why it was taking so long, and the more I got stressed !</p>

<h2>Be bold and say No !</h2>

<p>If we are sure something we should not do something, we need to say so. Badass developers are not afraid to say they won&rsquo;t do it. <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/">Good software engineering requires merciless prioritization</a>. If there are doubt about the value of doing something, it&rsquo;s often a better idea to make sure before wasting time on it.</p>

<p>There are many ways to say &lsquo;No&rsquo;. Before giving a harsh &lsquo;No&rsquo;, we can try to challenge decisions. We can ask for clarifications and rationals through open questions. Very often, highlighting the risks makes people review their plans. As technical experts, we should also share as much of the consequences as possible.</p>

<p>In the end, badass developers are ready to leave a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fubared">FUBARed</a> situation. Great engineers don&rsquo;t have troubles finding jobs these days &hellip; There&rsquo;s no reason they should accept to be waisting their time.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 In the end, badass developers are ready to leave a FUBARed situation</p></blockquote>

<h2>What do to next ?</h2>

<p>As we become badass developers, our reputation will grow. We&rsquo;ll be in a better position to negotiate a large scale refactoring with the business. There&rsquo;s a catch though : we&rsquo;ll need to live up to our reputation ! Admitting that we are wrong 100% with candor will not make it ! </p>

<p>When we manage to negotiate a large scale refactoring, the team will need to do a good job of it. This boils down to delivering it piece by piece, alongside features. This is exactly what my <a href="http://eepurl.com/dxKE95">next post</a> will be about.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is a one sentence summary of my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/why-we-need-badass-developers-to-perform-large-scale-refactorings/">previous post</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Badass developers negotiate large scale refactorings with the business better.</p></blockquote>

<p> Unfortunately, not all of us are sitting next to a true badass developer &hellip; Hopefully, we can all become one ! Depending on our track record, it&rsquo;s going to be more or less difficult, but with time and the good attitude, we can all do it. Becoming a badass developer is all about trustworthiness.</p>

<p>This post is the third in a <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/large-scale-refactoring-sponsorship-series/">series about how to get sponsorship for a large scale refactoring</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, I recommend you to start from <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to become trustworthy is to avoid things that kill trust. Sounds obvious, but it&rsquo;s very easy to forget. Here are 5 examples of trust killers you should never do if you want to become a badass developer.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-07-03-5-mistakes-badass-developers-never-do/mistake.jpg" alt="Drawing of a hurt finger after someone made a mistake with a hammer. Badass developer don't do this kind of mistakes !" /></p>

<h2>Resume Driven Development</h2>

<p>We should pick the best tools for the job. The best tools are often a bit old, precisely because they&rsquo;ve been battle tested in production for a while ! That&rsquo;s exactly the kind of technologies you want your business to rely on.</p>

<p>To keep his skills up to date, a badass developer will not add a funky new tech in the production code. He would rather negotiate <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">slack time</a> with the business. He might also openly <em>take</em> his Friday afternoons to experiment the latest techs ! He would simply explain that it&rsquo;s to avoid polluting the production system.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 A badass developer will not add a funky new tech in the production code.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Over-engineering</h2>

<p>Gold plating or over-engineering are similar anti-patterns. A badass developer always keeps the business&rsquo;s interest in mind. This means he knows how to balance long term design and short term features. A good rule of thumb is to keep a vision in sight, but to get there in baby steps.</p>

<h2>Build features with no agreed upon value</h2>

<p>Product managers are here to select what should and what should not be in the product. As product experts, they are the ones who know how much a feature is worth. Except (maybe) when we are building tools for others developers, they know better than us. Adding something of dubious value in the product is bad in two ways. </p>

<ul>
<li>First, it takes some time to build, time that we could use to build valuable features instead. Remember : <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/real-developers-ship/">Real developers ship</a> !</li>
<li>Second, it creates unnecessary code to maintain. In the worst case, it can <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/incremental-architecture-a-cure-against-architecture-astronauts/">constraint the architecture</a>. Which might eventually prevent us from adding other more valuable features afterwards.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Hide in a tunnel</h2>

<p>We should always be careful of the tunnel effect. Seeing their money vanishing with no visible output makes business people, understandably, creepy. As soon as things become too complicated, a badass developer will raise the alarm. The fact is that he has been in this kind of situation before, and knows how to recognize it. At that point, it&rsquo;s still possible to discuss the problem with everyone, and adjust the plan.</p>

<p>As an interesting side note, I was at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/DDD-Paris/">Paris DDD Meetup</a> last Thursday. We had the chance to welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/ericevans0">Eric Evans</a> as a surprise guest ! When asked what were his worst mistakes, he said something along this line :</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Some of my biggest mistakes were not backtracking soon enough a few times as I was drifting in quagmire. Eric Evans</p></blockquote>

<h2>Let the team down</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not only about getting the business&rsquo;s trust. We must also build trust from our fellow developers. Whenever we break the build and leave, or worse, deploy and leave, that trust is gone for a long while&hellip; We should not do that !</p>

<h2>There&rsquo;s more to a badass developer</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m done with this list of things badass developers don&rsquo;t do. Avoiding these is only the first step to become a badass developer. In <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/principles-that-will-make-you-become-a-badass-developer/">next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll write about what we need to do if we want to build strong trust with the business.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/">My last post</a> was about the challenge for dev teams to get sponsorship for large scale refactorings. I listed two main reasons :</p>

<ol>
<li>The business doubts developers to have their interests in mind</li>
<li>They are also not aware of the cost of the current technical debt</li>
</ol>


<p>This post (and the next) will be about how to gain the business&rsquo;s trust. This is exactly where badass developers can help. Let me start with a story.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-27-why-we-need-badass-developers-to-perform-large-scale-refactorings/badass-dev.jpg" alt="Drawing of 2 hands of a badass developer over his keyboard, with &quot;&gt;badass&lt;&quot; tatooed on his fingers" /></p>

<p>Back in 2002, at my first job, I started to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8">Refactoring, Improving the Design of Existing code</a>. That&rsquo;s where I read about unit testing. I found it so great that I made a demo to other programmers. Being the junior dev in the team, my co-workers reaction was something between &ldquo;Meh&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maybe&rdquo;. Fortunately, a more experienced and respected developer gave it a try. A few weeks after my demo, he announced to the team that unit testing worked great on new code. This time, people showed no questioning about his opinion : he if said so, it must have been true. Even business people blessed the practice !</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-27-why-we-need-badass-developers-to-perform-large-scale-refactorings/refactoring.jpg" alt="The &quot;Refactoring, improving the design of existing code&quot; cover. Badass developers know how to perform large scale refactoring" /></a></p>

<p>I had given a good live coding demo, but it was this respected developer&rsquo;s opinion that won the point. To convince business people of sponsoring a large scale refactoring, we need their trust. That&rsquo;s why we need badass developers around.</p>

<p>Badass developers are first of all people who are credible to the business. This usually implies a track record of <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/real-developers-ship/">delivering features</a> and refactorings. Badass developers understand the business constraints. That&rsquo;s why they learned how to deliver <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/7-reasons-why-learning-refactoring-techniques-will-improve-your-life-as-a-software-engineer/">refactorings alongside features</a>. They also need to be responsible and bold enough to <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/are-software-developers-overworked-or-undecided/">stand ground in front of the business</a>. Finally, badass developers are able to train others.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Badass developers are first of all people who are credible to the business</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, there are not so many badass developers in the industry &hellip; <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/developer-are-you-losing-your-rat-race/">It has a youngster bias</a>, and tends to push experienced developers to other activities. As if 10 years of systems design was less valuable than knowing the latest language !</p>

<h2>Learn more about Badasss developers</h2>

<p>I tried to find other words before resorting to &lsquo;Badass&rsquo;. Unfortunately, I could find none that got the point so clearly. <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/">Uncle bob</a> calls them &lsquo;software professionals&rsquo; in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8">The Clean Coder</a>. Professionalism is not specific enough to me. Adam Nowak also calls them &lsquo;responsible developers&rsquo; in a <a href="https://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/03/28/how-to-be-a-responsible-developer/">blog post</a>.  That does not convey the idea that, sometimes devs need to stand guard in front of the business.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-27-why-we-need-badass-developers-to-perform-large-scale-refactorings/clean-coder.jpg" alt="The clean coder book cover.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I present or suggest a good practice to dev teams, I often get the same remark. Here is how it goes :</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>That&rsquo;s a great idea and we would love to do this, but our code is in such a mess that we cannot !</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe you should start doing more refactoring then !</p></li>
<li><p>We would like to, but we don&rsquo;t have the time. We are fire fighting all the time.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like the old adage of the lumberjack that is too busy to cut wood to sharpen his axe&hellip; The sad part here, is that most of the time, developers know they would be a lot faster if they could clean up their code. Unfortunately, they are usually not given the time.</p>

<h2>How do we end up in this silly situation ?</h2>

<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-15-how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/why-are-large-scale-refactorings-not-prioritized.jpg"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-15-how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/why-are-large-scale-refactorings-not-prioritized-small.jpg" alt="Drawing of a '5 whys' mind map explaining why it is difficult to get sponsorship for a large scale refactoring" /></a></p>

<h3>Only developers see the bad code</h3>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/the-size-of-code/">already been joking about</a>, code is invisible. Mess in the code even more so, especially to people who don&rsquo;t code. The code could look like that and no one would notice.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_syndrome"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-15-how-to-convince-your-business-to-sponsor-a-large-scale-refactoring/Syllogomanie-Puteaux.jpg" alt="Inside of a kitchen from someone suffering from Diogenes syndrome" /></a></p>

<br>


<p>If someone put his own office in that state, he would get fired, but not for the source code. The good side is that we, developers, are safe, we can continue to wreak chaos without fear ! That&rsquo;s pretty weird when we think that this is what we ship to customers &hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_syndrome">Diogenes syndrome</a> for source code a recognized pathology ?</p></blockquote>

<p>Business might also not see bad code because that&rsquo;s the only thing they&rsquo;re used to ! Maybe they&rsquo;ve always been working in dysfunctional organizations that systematically create crappy code. Slow teams, late deliveries and fire fighting might be business as usual for them. From this point of view, trying to improve code is a pure waste of time and energy. The same goes for large scale refactorings.</p>

<p>The worse part of all this is that if devs don&rsquo;t have the time to keep their code clean, it will only get worse. This will reinforce the view that software delivery is slow and that there is nothing to do about it !</p>

<h3>Business has been burnt in the past !</h3>

<p>Bad experiences are another reason why business is unwilling to sponsor refactoring. Did someone sell them an unrealistic productivity boost that turned in a never-ending tunnel project ? Badly managed large scale refactorings deliver late, create no value, and a lot of bugs. At one company I worked for, business gave devs 1 full year (!) to clean up the code &hellip; We took 2 !! Meanwhile, the CEO had to dilute the stocks a bit to keep the boat afloat ! I&rsquo;d think twice before giving this kind of mandate myself.</p>

<p>Performing a large scale refactoring is not easy, and involves specific skills. These skills are about refactoring in baby steps, alongside feature delivery.</p>

<p>Usually, people acquire these skills through hard won experience &hellip; Unfortunately for us, our industry is not very nice to experienced engineers &hellip; It&rsquo;s a lot easier to hire a fresh grad who knows the latest javascript framework than a 2 decades engineer. (Who, BTW, could learn this framework in 2 weeks &hellip;) It&rsquo;s also a lot harder for the junior developer to succeed in negotiating a refactoring.</p>

<p>Again the twist of fate is that junior engineers are a lot more likely to start a submarine latest-framework.js rewrite supposed to solve all maintenance issues &hellip; which will only make things worse.</p>

<h2>Overestimate, only as last resort</h2>

<p>A quick fix is to systematically overestimate to get enough time to refactor. As any other &lsquo;submarine&rsquo; initiative, I would recommend it only in last resort, after you&rsquo;ve tried every other possible technique &hellip; and just before you quit.</p>

<p>Hiding things to the business people kills trust and hides problems. Trust and collaboration is what you need to get the business to sponsor large scale refactorings ! Plus, if ever you mess up (as submarine initiative often do) you&rsquo;ll be the only one to blame &hellip;</p>

<p>That said, &lsquo;overestimating&rsquo; so that you can write clean code is ok. It&rsquo;s not overestimating, it&rsquo;s estimating to do a good job.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 We should never ask the permission to do a good job. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfWCRl75Kas">Doc Norton</a>)</p></blockquote>

    <category term="continuous improvement" /><category term="personal-productivity" /><category term="remote" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had the chance to attend <a href="https://www.devoxx.fr/">Devoxx France</a> this year in Paris. Here is the most important lesson I learned :</p>

<blockquote><p>How to avoid unnecessary meetings with asynchronous decision making</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bdelacretaz">Bertrand Delacretaz</a>, a member of the Apache foundation. He gave a great talk about how the open source community handles decision taking. Open source developers are often all over the world, often in different timezones. Meetings are not an option for them. Still, they manage to make great decisions !</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-05-how-to-avoid-unnecessary-meetings-a-takeaway-from-devoxx-france-2018/decision.jpg" alt="Drawing of a decision hammer" /></p>

<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t work remotely, avoiding unnecessary meetings is always a great thing !</p>

<ol>
<li>You&rsquo;ll have more time to do productive and interesting stuff</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll avoid interruptions and be even more productive</li>
<li>If you are an introvert, it&rsquo;s going to be easier to contribute to the decision</li>
<li>As people have more time to think through the decision, the result is usually better</li>
</ol>


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xkC4zjtAyRc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>For a full walkthrough, I encourage you to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkC4zjtAyRc">the talk in full length</a>. If you don&rsquo;t speak french, an english version is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF-bjxB2Nrk&amp;t=217s">here</a>. Finally, slides are also available in <a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz/prise-de-dcisions-asynchrone-devoxx-france-2018">french</a> and <a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz/asynchronous-decision-making-foss-backstage-2017">english</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Even if you don&rsquo;t work remotely, avoiding unnecessary meetings is always a great thing !</p></blockquote>

<h2>Crash course</h2>

<p>For the hasty folks among you, here is a summary. The decision making follows 4 stages :</p>

<ol>
<li>Open discussion and brainstorming. People discuss openly and suggest ideas in a free form manner.</li>
<li>Emergence of options. After enough discussion, a few options will start to make more sense than others.</li>
<li>Coming to a consensus. Someone will draft a formal proposal. People will discuss and amend this proposal until they reach consensus. <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/consensus">Consensus</a> is not <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/unanimous">unanimity</a> !</li>
<li>Decision. After consensus, the benevolent decision owner validates the decision once and for all.</li>
</ol>


<p>Until the decision is taken, the process can move forward but also backward.</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>

<p>We need only two tools to make this possible :</p>

<ol>
<li>For discussion, brainstorming and emergence of options, use a very open and chatty tool. The speaker called this a &ldquo;shared asynchronous communication channel&rdquo;. This can be an online chat, a mailing list or Github issues (<a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-discuss/issues">ex</a>). It could even be a real life whiteboard if you all had access to it.</li>
<li>From drafting the proposal to the end, prefer a structured and chronological tool. The speaker suggests using a &ldquo;shared case management tool&rdquo;. Draft the proposal in this tool, and use comments to log the latest steps of the decision taking. He had examples using Jira issues (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-7231">ex</a>) or Github pull requests (<a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-discuss/pulls">ex</a>). To confirm the decision, close the case. The tool will record which version of the decision was exactly taken.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Architecture Decision Record</h2>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-05-how-to-avoid-unnecessary-meetings-a-takeaway-from-devoxx-france-2018/adr.jpg" alt="Drawing of an Architecture Decision Record which work great with asynchronous decision making" /></p>

<p><a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions">ADR</a> is the practice of documenting architecture decisions. It makes sure we remember why we took a decision. This can be very useful to know how to deal with the existing software. A widespread practice for ADRs is to use simple text files in git. There are even <a href="https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools">tools for that</a>. This looks like a perfect fit for decision making using git pull requests ! I&rsquo;ll write a post about that when I get the chance to try.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Git pull requests based asynchronous decision making is a perfect fit for Architecture Decision Records.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Currently experimenting</h2>

<p>I am currently trying this whole decision making technique at work. We are still in the brainstorming phase. We are using our internal chat app for that. Options are starting to emerge, but we did not move to the consensus part yet. I&rsquo;ll write a return on experience post when we reach the end.</p>

    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/a-coding-dojo-exercises-plan-towards-refactoring-legacy-code</id>
    <category term="coding dojo" /><category term="tdd" /><category term="technical debt" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My current job <a href="http://www.murex.com">at work</a> is technical coach. I&rsquo;m available for teams that need help to adopt incremental coding practices.</p>

<h2>Problems with refactoring legacy code</h2>

<p>A few months ago, a team which was struggling with a lot of legacy code asked for help. As you might know if you read my blog, I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development (TDD)</a> because it has made my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/from-apprentice-to-master-how-to-learn-tdd-test-driven-development/">life as a developer so much more easy</a>. I&rsquo;m so used to TDD now, that even if I don&rsquo;t have tests yet (as is the case when refactoring legacy code), TDD helps me :</p>

<ul>
<li>To stick to baby steps which are a lot less likely to fail than larges changes.</li>
<li>Write testable code. I know what testable code looks like, and when refactoring, I&rsquo;ll try to change it towards that.</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s why we started to run regular, all team, <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/team-randori-series/">coding dojo randoris</a>. It was nice for the <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/why-you-should-start-a-team-coding-dojo-randori-right-now/">team dynamics</a>, and the people where learning a lot of technical skills. I also got the feedback that they where not able to apply this directly on their day to day job though. After a bit more discussion, I understood that they did not know where this was going, what to expect, and when !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Test Driven Development also teaches you what testable code looks like.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The coding dojo exercices</h2>

<p>It turned out that a coding dojo exercises plan was enough to answer their questions. This is what it looks like.</p>

<h3>Drawing</h3>

<h3>Mind Map</h3>

<p>Here is another, more concrete, version, with sample names of katas we can find online.</p>

<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-04-a-coding-dojo-exercises-plan-towards-refactoring-legacy-code/TDD_Kata_Plan.jpg"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-04-a-coding-dojo-exercises-plan-towards-refactoring-legacy-code/TDD_Kata_Plan-small.jpg" alt="An mind map of Coding Dojo Exercises plan leading to the mastery of Legacy Code Refactoring" /></a></p>

<h3>Text</h3>

<p>It starts with simple greenfield katas :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/">Fizz Buzz</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/">Roman Numerals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/">Bowling</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It goes on to intermediate katas, where we can use TDD to do design :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata">Mars Rover</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/PokerHands/">Poker Hands</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/TradingCardGame/">trading card game</a></li>
</ul>


<p>From then on, it&rsquo;s possible to tackle advanced katas and styles :</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactoring fresh code

<ul>
<li>Continue design katas on 2 or more sessions</li>
<li>Always compile Constraint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bottom-up TDD

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/GameOfLife/">Game of Life</a></li>
<li>Median of a list of lists (with no concatenation)</li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/LangtonAnt/">Langton ant</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Top-Down TDD

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Potter/">Kata Potter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/NumberToLCD/">LCD</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TDD on algorithms

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Diamond/">Diamond</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Lags/">Kata Lags</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Anagram/">anagrams</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>All this opens the gate to legacy code refactoring katas :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata">Gilded Rose</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emilybache/Racing-Car-Katas">Race Car Katas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jbrains/trivia">Ugly trivia game</a></li>
<li>Others from <a href="http://kata-log.rocks">http://kata-log.rocks</a></li>
</ul>


<p>At that point, the team can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming">mob</a> to refactor production code :</p>

<ul>
<li>Real life, static analysis issue, mob programming session</li>
<li>Real life, code smell, mob programming session</li>
<li>Real life, larger mob Refactoring</li>
</ul>


<h2>What changed in practice ?</h2>

<p>We wanted to split the teamwork and the coding dojos exercises. The team is now doing mob programming sessions on their usual stories twice a week (I&rsquo;ll blog about that someday). But also doing regular coding dojos exercises in pairs.</p>

<p>Even if they did not go through all the TDD katas yet, mobbing on real stories helps the team to take on legacy code.</p>

<blockquote><p>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. Linus&rsquo;s Law</p></blockquote>

<p>Working in pairs on the code katas allows them to be more engaged in the exercises. In the end, it brings faster learning.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 A mix of Coding Dojos in pairs and Mob Programming sessions is a good way to teach TDD in a Legacy Code context.</p></blockquote>

    <category term="architecture" /><category term="how-to-avoid-mocks-series" /><category term="mocking" /><category term="programming" /><category term="ruby" /><category term="tdd" /><category term="testing" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the previous 7 articles of <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">this series</a>, I&rsquo;ve tried my best get rid of mocks. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that using these techniques will get you a long way out of <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">mock hell</a>. Excessive mocking leads to unmaintainable tests. Unmaintainable tests lead to low coverage. Low coverage ultimately leads to legacy code. If you haven&rsquo;t already, I encourage you to start reading from <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>One question remains though : Is it realistic to get rid of <em>all</em> mocks ? An even better question would be : Are mocks always bad ? Are there situations when mocking is the best choice ?</p>

<h2>When mocking still makes sense</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s to through a few examples.</p>

<h3>Testing a generic wrapper</h3>

<p>A few years ago, I had to write a service for an enterprise system. As any service, I had to ensure that it was returning nice errors. We decided to capture and wrap all errors from a few &lsquo;gate&rsquo; points in the code. We built a generic wrapper that did only delegation plus exception wrapping. In this case, it made a lot more sense to test this with a mocking framework.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Not only did we reuse the wrapper many times in my service. We also ended up using it in other services as well !</p>

<h3>Injecting a hand written in-memory fake</h3>

<p>As you might have noticed, in <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/get-rid-of-mocking-maintenance-with-full-fledged-in-memory-fakes/">the previous article</a>, I recommended to use an in-memory fake instead of mocks. By nature, an in-memory fake is a kind of mock. Even if it is not defined by a mocking framework. (I actually think that by making mocking so easy, mocking frameworks often do more harm than good.)</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 By making mocking so easy, mocking frameworks often do more harm than good.</p></blockquote>

<p>Still, I used <code>const_stub(...)</code> to inject the in-memory fake.</p>

<p>I did this for 2 reasons :</p>

<ul>
<li>Production code can continue to use a straightforward constant</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t risk forgetting to remove the mock at the end of its lifecycle, the framework does this for me</li>
<li>As I&rsquo;m injecting the same fake for all tests, there is not much risk of test conflict (for the moment)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Testing a cache</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;raison d&#8217;être&rdquo; of a cache is to avoid doing something twice. It should also return the same results as if it was not there. This is by nature almost impossible to test with state based assertions. Mock frameworks are great for this situation though. Here is an example :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">context</span> <span class="s2">&quot;UsersController&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">   </span><span class="n">controller</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">login</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Joe&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;secret&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">   </span><span class="n">controller</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">login</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Joe&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;secret&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err"> </span><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The assertion could not be more explicit, we are checking that the expensive load was only done once.</p>

<h3>Legacy code</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-01-when-is-testing-using-mocks-still-a-good-idea/legacy-code.jpg" alt="Michael C.Feathers explains that testing using mocks is a key practice in &quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> <a href="https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/">Michael Feathers</a> explains how to exploit <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=359417&amp;seqNum=2">&ldquo;seams&rdquo;</a> in the code to put it under test. Mocking is straightforward way to inject behavior through a seam.</p>

<p>Mocking is a pretty good starting point but we need to be careful and keep a few things in mind. Legacy or not, we must not forget that too many mocks will make tests unmaintainable !</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a good idea to refer to a target design or architecture blueprint to know where to inject mocks. (I&rsquo;ll write a post about this one day). This increases the chances to replace them with an in-memory fake later down the road.</li>
<li>Plan to replace the mocks with a better design as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>


<h3>It depends &hellip;</h3>

<p>As with anything in software, there is no absolute rule about mocking. Even if I prefer not to 99% of the time, there are situation when testing using mocks is the thing to do. Knowing the risks, it&rsquo;s up to you to decide !</p>

<h2>If using a mock, prefer spy / proxies</h2>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-06-01-when-is-testing-using-mocks-still-a-good-idea/proxy-plug.jpg" alt="Spies and proxies make testing using mocks less intrusive" /></p>

<p>As I explained in previous posts, mocks duplicate behavior. If we could use mocks without duplicating behavior, they would do less harm.</p>

<p>It turns out there is a flavor of mocks for that : <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">spies</a> and <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/docs/configuring-responses/calling-the-original-implementation">overlooked proxies</a>. Proxies do the real thing but also record the calls and return values. It&rsquo;s as non-intrusive as mocks can be.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Proxy mocks are as unintrusive as mocks can be.</p></blockquote>

<p>For example, here is how our cache test would look like using a proxy :</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more verbose, but simpler. Most mock frameworks provide some form of spy or proxies. A few years ago, I also wrote <a href="http://philou.github.io/rspecproxies">rspecproxies</a>, a wrapper on top of <a href="http://rspec.info/">rspec</a> to make this easier.</p>

Unfortunately, that does not remove all mocks, yet it groups them in the same, less critical, zone. In last week&rsquo;s code sample, this was the controller. I concluded that at least, this was easier to manage. Let&rsquo;s see how.</p>

<p>This is the 7th post in <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">a series about avoiding mocks</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, you might start from <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<h2>Mock concentration</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/avoid-mocks-and-test-your-core-domain-faster-with-hexagonal-architecture/">last post</a>&rsquo;s code sample. As a reminder, it&rsquo;s a very basic TODO app built on <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. I extracted the domain part, the tasks, in a core domain area. This allowed to push all mocks out of this section. A consequence though, is that all mocks gathered in the controller test. Here is the controller code :</p>

<p>We need to <a href="https://blog.pragmatists.com/test-doubles-fakes-mocks-and-stubs-1a7491dfa3da">stub out</a> the twitter API for most tests. We are also still using a mock to verify that the tweet is sent. Finally, as we can see from the test execution times, we are still using the database in some tests.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-05-28-get-rid-of-mocking-maintenance-with-full-fledged-in-memory-fakes/test-timings.jpg" alt="Screen capture of the tests execution time" /></p>

<p>If the project grew large this would become an issue. Sadly, mocking is often the fix people jump on &hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Mocking is the unfortunate quick fix to slow tests.</p></blockquote>

<p>From a mocking point of view, our current controller test can seem worse than before ! There&rsquo;s something pretty effective we can do though !</p>

<h2>In memory fakes</h2>

<p>Instead of stubbing and mocking in every test, let&rsquo;s write a full fledged in-memory <a href="https://blog.pragmatists.com/test-doubles-fakes-mocks-and-stubs-1a7491dfa3da">fake</a> that does the job we need. We could then install it once and for all, and forget about it !</p>

<p>Actually, this is nothing new. This is exactly what Rails provides out of the box with <code>ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :test</code>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how we could do the same thing for our Twitter Client.</p>

<p>Simple isn&rsquo;t it ?</p>

<h2>Wait a sec &hellip;</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a catch though &hellip; How do we make sure that this fake is behaving the same way as the real thing ?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s run the same tests on both ! We could mimic the twitter API in our fake, but that might not be a great idea. Do you remember the moto &ldquo;Always wrap your 3rd parties&rdquo; ? It takes all its meaning here, for 2 reasons.</p>

<p>The first is to make faking easier. We can build a minimal wrapper API that is just enough for our use. By keeping this interface small, we&rsquo;ll make it a lot easier to fake.</p>

<p>The second reason is that we can write real integration tests on the 3rd party through this wrapper. They&rsquo;d look like ordinary unit tests, except that they&rsquo;d end up calling the real 3rd party in a sandbox. They are usually pretty slow, but as 3rd parties don&rsquo;t change everyday, that&rsquo;s ok. We can ensure up-front that integration will go well. As a bonus, we can be very fast to detect and contain changes to online services. (I&rsquo;m looking at you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">Scrappers</a>!)</p>

<p>Here is what it would look like for our Twitter client :</p>

<p>We had to add a search method to our interface for the sake of testing. This should remain &ldquo;For testing only&rdquo;. We&rsquo;d also adapt the controller test to use this <code>search_tweets</code> method.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at where we stand now. We&rsquo;re injecting each mock only once. Tests are fast yet straightforward, almost as if they were testing the real thing. Doing so, we&rsquo;ve split our system in cohesive parts and we&rsquo;ve wrapped our 3rd parties. We&rsquo;ve actually done a lot more than removing mocks ! <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a">Mocking really is a design smell</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Merciless mock hunting will improve the design of your system !</p></blockquote>

<h2>Last word about implementation</h2>

<p>Sometimes, this 3rd party wrapper can become pretty complicated. Try to reuse as much of it as possible between the real and the fake. For example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a>, like ActiveRecord for example, is a wrapper around the database. Reimplementing a fake ORM would be real challenge. We&rsquo;re far better <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-minutes-hack-to-speed-up-rspec-in-rails-5-using-in-memory-sqlite/">plugin it on top of SQLite</a> instead !</p>

<h2>Why do we end up with mocks in large systems ?</h2>

<p>A few years ago, I joined a team working in a legacy system. We wanted to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> and refactoring. As expected, adding tests legacy code proved a real challenge. With a lot of effort we could manage to add a few. Unfortunately, this did not seem to have any positive effect on our maintainability ! The tests we were writing all involved a lot of mocking. The system was such a large mass of spaghetti code that there was no clear place to mock. We were actually mocking where it seemed the easiest on a test by test basis. We were making progress at small scale, but the big picture was not improving at all !</p>

<p>Large systems are beasts with many faces. They  involve a lot of IOs. They write and read data from the disk and databases. They call 3rd parties and remote services.</p>

<p>As we test these large systems, we&rsquo;ll need to stub out these IOs. Even if the tests are fast enough, we usually don&rsquo;t want to call external services for real. Most of the time though, tests are slow. That&rsquo;s 2 reasons why end up adding some mocks.</p>

<p>Here comes the nasty part. These large systems are so complex that we, developers, don&rsquo;t have the full picture. When we test, we tend to mock at different places, depending on our knowledge. This is bad for maintenance. Mocks duplicate production code behavior. When many different mocks are in place to isolate an external dependency, we end up with &lsquo;n&rsquo; versions of the code. That&rsquo;s a nightmare to refactor !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 When many different mocks are in place to isolate an external dependency, we end up with &lsquo;n&rsquo; versions of the code !</p></blockquote>

<h2>Hexagonal architecture to the rescue</h2>

<p><a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Alistair Cockburn</a> coined the term. The idea is pretty simple :  isolate a piece of code from all dependencies. This is particularly useful for the core functional areas. With this in place, it becomes straightforward (and fast) to test the core domain logic.</p>

<p>To main techniques to isolate a piece of code from any dependency are :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency injection</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">Adapters</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to split a system in many &lsquo;hexagons&rsquo; and glue them together with adapters at startup. If you want to learn more on this style of architecture, have a look into the <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextmapping">Domain Driven Design lore</a>. This community has been building systems this way for years now.</p>

<h2>Enough talk, show me the code !</h2>

<p>This post was the occasion to try to inject a Hexagonal Architecture and a dash of DDD in a Rails application. There&rsquo;s one caveat though : DDD shines on complex systems. Unfortunately, large and complex systems make very poor didactic examples. The following code highlights the gains about mocking. We would not use DDD for such a small app in real life.</p>

<h3>The starting point</h3>

<p>I chose a simple TODO app. I started by generating a scaffold for a Task with a description and a done/not-done status. As third party interaction, completing a task sends an automatic tweet. Here is the only specific code I wrote on top of the Rails scaffold :</p>

<p>This is pretty simple and to the point !</p>

<h3>5 years later</h3>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s imagine that the app grew to tens of thousands of lines. We added a lot of features to the app, which transformed the TODO domain into a very complex thing. Now suppose that, for the sake of maintenance, we want to isolate the domain logic into its own hexagon. Unlike traditional Rails ActiveRecords, we want to make it independent from the database. We also want it to be independent from the Twitter API.</p>

<p>Here is what the code might look like.</p>

<h6>lib/core/task.rb</h6>

<p>First, we have a core task class, independent from anything else. The Core module is our hexagon.</p>

<p>The main gain here is that our core domain, our most valuable asset is now easy to test without mocks. This means that we are able to write and execute fast tests for this area of the code. This puts us in a great position to increase our competitive advantage in our core business !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 By keeping your tests around your core domain fast, Hexagonal Architecture increases your competitive advantage.</p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, we are now wiring everything together at the controller level. We could later build a facade to isolate the controller from the inside of our domain. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">presenter</a> might do, but it seemed over-engineered, even in this made up example. (I&rsquo;ll post something about that some day)</p>

<h2>Next post</h2>

<p>As we can deduce from the controller code above, we still have to use fakes or mocks when testing the controller. The good thing though is that this is now more local which already makes mocking less of an issue. If a mock is used in less tests, it&rsquo;s easier to use the same mock everywhere ! This is a great opportunity for simplifying test setup, as we&rsquo;ll see in the <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/get-rid-of-mocking-maintenance-with-full-fledged-in-memory-fakes/">next post about in-memory fakes</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I cannot write a <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">series about avoiding mocks</a> without mentioning Custom Assertion Matchers. If you don&rsquo;t know what custom assertions are, here is pseudo code that uses a custom assertion :</p>

<p>For more details, have a look at these examples for your preferred language : <a href="http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-custom-assertions.html">Java</a>, <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/custom-matchers">Ruby</a> or <a href="http://tonylukasavage.com/blog/2014/05/29/custom-assertions-in-should-dot-js/">Javascript</a>.</p>

<p>That custom assertion matchers have an effect on mock usage might seem puzzling at first. Let me explain. Us, mere human developers, get lured into mocking when tests become too complicated. By keeping the tests simpler, Custom Assertion Matchers help use to avoid mocks. It&rsquo;s a bit like why test data builders keep mocks at bay.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 We get lured into mocking when tests become too complicated</p></blockquote>

<p>I already blogged about <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/speed-up-the-tdd-feedback-loop-with-better-assertion-messages/">the benefits of Custom Assertion Matchers</a>. Here I&rsquo;m going to dive in their advantages against mocking.</p>

<p>This is the fifth post in a <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">series about how to avoid mocks</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, I recommend you to start from <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<h2>Why would we end up with mocks when we don&rsquo;t have matchers ?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walkthrough a small story. Suppose we are building an e-commerce website. When someone passes an order, we want to notify the analytics service. Here is some very simple code for that.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s focus on the tests a bit. We first notice that the verification section is large and difficult to understand.  Looking in more details, it knows too much about the internals of AnalyticsService. We had to make the items accessor public just for the sake of testing. The test even knows how the items are stored in a list of hashes. If we were to refactor this representation, we would have to change the tests as well.</p>

<p>We could argue that responsibility-wise, our test should only focus on Order. It makes sense for the test to use a mock to verify that the Order calls AnalyticsService as expected. Let&rsquo;s see what this would look like.</p>

<p>Sure, the test code is simpler. It&rsquo;s also better according to good design principles. The only glitch is that we now have a mock in place with all the problems I described <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">before</a>.</p>

<p>This might not (yet) be a problem in our example but, for example, the mock &lsquo;cuts&rsquo; the execution of the program. Suppose that someday, the Order starts expecting something from the AnalyticsService. We&rsquo;d then need to &lsquo;simulate&rsquo; the real behavior in our mock. This would make the test very hard to maintain.</p>

<h2>Matchers to the rescue</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how a matcher could help us here. The idea is to improve on the first &lsquo;state checking&rsquo; solution to make it better than the mock one. We&rsquo;ll extract and isolate all the state checking code in a custom matcher. By factorizing the code in a single matcher, we&rsquo;ll reduce duplication. The matcher remains too intimate with the object, but as it is now unique and well named, it&rsquo;s less of a problem. Plus, as always with matchers, we improved readability.</p>

<h2>Design improvements</h2>

<p>Depending on your situation, you might find further design improvements. In our example, a publish-subscribe pattern might do. A better design is likely to fix the encapsulation problem of the matcher. Here again, the custom assertion matchers will help. In most cases, it will be enough to change the implementation of the matchers only.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Custom assertion matchers make refactoring easier by factorizing test assertions.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary of small-scale techniques</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m done with small scale mock avoiding techniques. To summarize, the first thing to do is to push for more and more <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/">immutable value objects</a>. Not only does it help us to avoid mocks, but it will also provides many benefits for production code. Practices like <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-use-test-data-builders-to-avoid-mocks-and-keep-your-tests-clear/">Test Data Builders</a> and Custom Assertion Matchers simplify dealing with Immutable Value Objects in tests. They also help to keep tests small and clean, which is also a great thing against mocks.</p>

<h2>Next post</h2>

<p>In the following posts, I&rsquo;ll look into architecture scale techniques to avoid mocks. I&rsquo;ll start with <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/avoid-mocks-and-test-your-core-domain-faster-with-hexagonal-architecture/">Hexagonal architecture</a>.</p>

<p>This is the fourth post <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">of a series about how to avoid mocks</a> in automated tests. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, I recommend you to start from <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<h2>The problem with test data initialization</h2>

<p>Setting up the correct state for automated tests can be pretty verbose. This is especially true for software in complex domains or code with a lot of side effects.</p>

<p>The situation gets worse as tests need to setup similar but not exactly identical data. What I often see in code bases is a lot of test data setup duplication. For example, here are tests for a basic ticketing system.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that there&rsquo;s a huge amount of duplication in the tests data setups.</p>

<p>The straightforward fix against that is method extraction. This is the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html">Object Mother pattern</a>. Unfortunately, Object Mother breaks down under the number of variations. Every time you need a new change, you&rsquo;ll add a parameter to the Object Mother method. Long story short, you&rsquo;ll end up with code like that :</p>

<p>As you can see, we have less duplication, but the tests got both unreadable and intricate &hellip; Following <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/">my advices</a> and using more <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Immutable Value Objects</a> makes the situation worse ! When data is mutable, we can customize it after the call to the Object Mother method. If data is immutable, it all has to be setup at initialization &hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when the mock temptation strikes. Sometimes it&rsquo;s so much easier to mock a method rather than to initialize your data properly. It can be 1 line of mock instead of dealing with all this mess.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 If you are not careful, messy test initialization code will trick you into using mocks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Suppose we now want to make sure we can&rsquo;t add comments that were written before the ticket was created. We&rsquo;ll add the following</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one test (<code>latest change date is time of latest change if after comment</code>) where we were doing just this, will now fail. The fix would be to find a real situation for this test. Here this could be that the ticket is modified after the latest comment. If the tests are too messy though, a mock can be a quick and dirty fix the setup and make the test pass :</p>

<p>There is a third way : Test Data Builders</p>

<h2>What are test data builders</h2>

<p>As often, when design is not satisfying, adding an indirection solves the issue. Here the indirection takes shape of the Builder pattern.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Builder Pattern [</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern"><em>Wikipedia</em></a><em>] :</em></p>

<p>The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so the same construction process can create different representations.</p></blockquote>

<p>The idea is to use the builder pattern to build the test data. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525160355&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests</a> covers this technique in great length.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525160355&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-05-01-how-to-use-test-data-builders-to-avoid-mocks-and-keep-your-tests-clear/growing.jpg" alt="Cover of the book Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see, it provides default test values, and we only need to provide the custom values we care about. This makes the test code both readable and intention revealing. Making the tests more understandable helps a lot to find ways to avoid mocks. Here, we replaced the mock on the comment time by an update to the ticket after the last comment.</p>

<p>The pattern applies in many languages, even if implementations will be different. In Ruby, libraries like <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot">factory_bot</a> avoid a lot of boilerplate code. Have a look at <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000769.html">this article</a> for examples in Java.</p>

<h2>Other advantages</h2>

<p>Test data builders have another second effect benefit. When setting up the data is complicated, we are likely to add more that one assertion in a test. Unit tests can end up looking like a mini scenario to avoid duplicating this test setup.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to create a specific tests for every assertion with Test Data Builders. By doing so we get smaller and more focused tests, which bring :</p>

<ul>
<li>Better names for tests</li>
<li>More readable tests</li>
<li>Faster diagnostic of the problem when a particular test fails</li>
<li>🎁 Better coverage ! In a large test, all assertions work on the same input values. When we have many small tests, we can use a different value in each.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 By simplifying the creation of new tests with different data, Test Data Builders increase code coverage in the long term!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Fizz Buzz Example</h2>

<p>As a simple example, I&rsquo;ll go through the classic <a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/">Fizz Buzz</a>. I&rsquo;ve implemented and tested it with and without immutable value objects. Please keep in mind that this is a toy example, where problems are obvious and easily fixed. I try to highlight at small scale the same problems that get hidden by the complexity of a large scale program.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a typical FizzBuzz implementation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are a few problems with this code :</p>

<ul>
<li>With nested logic and complicated mock setup, both code and tests aren&rsquo;t very readable</li>
<li>They both seem to violate the single responsibility principle as well</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s depending on a mutable output. Within a larger program, something could be messing around with this output stream. That would break FizzBuzz.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s now try to use as many immutable values objects as possible, and see what happens to the mocks.</p>

<p>As we can see, using immutable value objects got us rid of the mocks. Obviously, this new code will not be as efficient as the original version, but most of the time, this does not matter. As a bonus though we get finer grain and more readable tests.</p>

<h3>Other testing advantages</h3>

<p>Appart from preventing mocks, Immutable Value Objects have other advantages related to testing.</p>

<ul>
<li>We can directly assert their equality, without having to dig into their guts</li>
<li>We can call methods as many times as we want, without the risk of changing anything and breaking the tests</li>
<li>Immutable Value Objects are a lot less likely to contain invalid state. This removes the need for a whole range of validity tests.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 Immutable Value Objects simplify testing in many ways.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Convincing your teammates</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that Immutable Value Objects have a ton of advantages when testing. People have found that they also have many other benefits :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140528113353-16837833-6-benefits-of-programming-with-immutable-objects-in-java/">6 Benefits of Programming with Immutable Objects in Java</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/5-benefits-of-immutable-objects-worth-considering-for-your-next-project-f98e7e85b6ac">5 Benefits of Immutable Objects Worth Considering for Your Next Project</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Surprisingly though, it&rsquo;s difficult to persuade programmers to use more immutability. It&rsquo;s tricky to explain why returning a modified copy is simpler than just adding a setter.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Why is it so hard to persuade other developers to use immutable data structures ?</p></blockquote>

<p>I had the most success by far when encountering a bug resulting of share mutable state. When this happens, the long term benefits and safety of the immutable design wins people over. The good thing is that as you convince more people in the team, immutability will spread like a virus !</p>

<p>Outside of this situation, you might try some of the following arguments to move people :</p>

<ul>
<li>Immutable values prevent bugs caused by different parts of the system changing the same mutable state</li>
<li>They make it easier to deal with the program in smaller parts and to reason about the system in general</li>
<li>Immutable values don&rsquo;t need any synchronization and make multithreaded programming easier</li>
<li>When tempted to add a simple setter instead of keeping a class immutable, highlight the stressful debugging time to come</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re dealing with a Design By Contract adept, explain how <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/almost-15-years-of-using-design-by-contract/">immutability has it built-in</a></li>
<li>Admit that mainstream languages have bad support for Immutable Value. Point to patterns like <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/immutability-with-builder-design-pattern">Data Builders</a> that work around these limitation</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Excessive use of mocks makes tests very painful to maintain. If we stick painful mocks for too long, we&rsquo;ll end up abandoning unit testing. Eventually, the system will degrade into legacy. </p>

<p>There are many techniques to avoid mocks. Some of the most effective involve architecture changes. Unfortunately, there are not the most straightforward to use. Re-architecting involves people and time that you may not dispose of right now. In the following posts, I&rsquo;ll go over techniques that any developer can use in his day to day code to avoid mocks. These battle tested techniques that I&rsquo;ve used on different projects in the past. Check <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">the previous post</a> if you&rsquo;re interested to learn how I came to use them.</p>

<p>This is the second post <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/how-to-avoid-mocks-series/">of a series about how to avoid mocks</a> in automated tests. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, I recommend you to read my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/careless-mocking-considered-harmful/">first post</a> to understand the perils of mocks in more details.</p>

<p>The first mock fighting small-scale technique I&rsquo;ll go over is <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Immutable Value Objects</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-04-17-how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/immutable-rock.jpg" alt="A drawing of a rock written &quot;Immutable Value Object&quot;" /></p>

<h2>What are Immutable Value Objects ?</h2>

<p>Behind this weird name is something very simple to understand. Immutable Value Objects :</p>

<ul>
<li>Cannot change their state after construction</li>
<li>Only depend on other Immutable Value Objects</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t change the state of the whole system in any way</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t do side effects, like inputs and outputs for example</li>
</ul>


<p>Eric Evans popularized the name in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523985269&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design">Domain-Driven Design Blue Book</a>. Immutable Value Objects have existed for decades in functional languages though. We say these objects are immutable (they cannot change) and pure (they cannot do side effects). Here are 2 interesting properties of Value Objects :</p>

<ul>
<li>you can call a method any number of times with no risk of changing anything to the system</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll always get the same result every time you call the same method on the same object</li>
</ul>


<p>These by itself, can already be handy when testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523985269&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-04-17-how-immutable-value-objects-fight-mocks/ddd.jpg" alt="Cover of Eric Evans's DDD book" /></a></p>

<h2>How do they prevent mocks ?</h2>

<p>That was a bit theoretical, so let&rsquo;s see how this helps to reduce mocking.</p>

<h3>Simpler &ldquo;init path&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take it the other way round and see how side effects can lead to mocking. Every test starts with setting the state in which to run the test. Side effects make this complicated, as many objects need to collaborate to set this state up. When this becomes too painful, people start hacking around with mocks. This in turn makes the tests more fragile :</p>

<ul>
<li>We are not testing a &ldquo;real&rdquo; situation</li>
<li>We need to keep this setup in line with the real code</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 Intricate state initialization encourage people to use mocks.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Isolates parts of the system</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, that is not all the story ! Mutable state also, tricks us into using mocks. As soon as your test deals with mutable state, there is a chance that this state is changed in the &lsquo;real&rsquo; system. This means that some bugs might &lsquo;escape&rsquo; unit tests and appear in end to end tests or in production. That&rsquo;s where the mocks strike ! In order to detect this bug in a fast feedback loop, we&rsquo;re likely to add larger scope tests and use mocks to speed them up &hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Mutable state and side effects make unit tests less effective.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Reduces code with side effects</h3>

<p>But there&rsquo;s another reason why Immutable Value Objects help us to avoid mocks. As we&rsquo;ll try to use them more and more for the previous two reasons, we&rsquo;ll need to adapt our programming style. As we&rsquo;ll push more and more code in Immutable Value Objects, the &lsquo;imperative&rsquo; part will shrink. This &lsquo;imperative&rsquo; part is where side-effect happen. This is the part where mocking out IOs makes sense. To summarize, the more Immutable Value Objects we use, the more isolated the IOs are, and the less mocking we need.</p>

<p>Javascript expert Eric Elliot also wrote about the immutability and mocks <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a">here</a>.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I managed to get a side project out of mock hell. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been using what I learned to avoid mocks in all the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on. This is the start of a series of posts about my mock-avoiding techniques.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-04-10-careless-mocking-considered-harmful/mocks-dont-rock.jpg" alt="A tag &quot;Mocks don't rock !&quot;" /></p>

<h2>Escape from Mock Hell</h2>

<p>Between 2010 and 2014, I was working on a side project I called <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses">http://mes-courses.fr</a>. Which actually means &ldquo;my house shopping&rdquo; in English. I wanted people to be able to do their house shopping in 5 minutes, by using a better UI for online groceries. I was using Ruby, and I had just read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523422024&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=growing+object-oriented+software+guided+by+tests">Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests</a>. I got a bit too excited with mocking, and was using it way too much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d been practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> for more than 5 years and I was expecting great results with a language like Ruby. After a few months though, I could feel that something was not going as well as it should. The test initialization code was getting longer and longer, as it included a lot of mock setup. This made the tests more complex and less readable. It also made them unreliable, as it was not rare for all my unit tests to pass while the system was not working. I was taking the habit of running my end to end test more and more often. I was also losing a lot of time maintaining the mock setup code in line with the real classes. Mocks also tricked me into the bad practice of keeping a 1 to 1 mapping between code and test files. That again increased my maintenance burden when moving code from one file to another.</p>

<p>It reached a point where I could not take it anymore. All these problems were pointing at mocks, so I tried to remove them from a test file. Here are the techniques I ended up using to remove them mocks : </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Objects</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builders</a></li>
<li><a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/custom-matchers">Test Matchers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Hexagonal architecture</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">In-memory fakes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wincent.com/wiki/Proxy_(test_double">Proxy doubles</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>The end result was beyond my hopes, as my problems almost magically disappeared. The code got simpler, I became a lot more confident about my unit tests, and they got easier to maintain. As an illustration, here is an excerpts from the diff of a rails controller test file which went through this mock diet.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/commit/2c9fce17f9b59d0b3828f309015c07b17cceddf4?diff=split"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-04-10-careless-mocking-considered-harmful/diff.jpg" alt="A screen capture of a Github diff showing a test file going on a mock diet" /></a></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the long term risk ?</h2>

<p>Basically, excessive mocking arms the maintainability of the tests. Here is what would have happened if I&rsquo;d done nothing. Tests would have become so painful to maintain that I would have started to ignore or delete them. As coverage would decrease, more and more code would become untested. That&rsquo;s exactly Michael Feathers&#8217; definition of Legacy Code :</p>

<blockquote><p>Legacy Code is code without tests. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523422039&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=legacy+code">Michael Feathers</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To summarize, excessive use of mocks leads to legacy code ! As most of us have learned the hard way, the further a system drifts into legacy, the lower the productivity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/20-hours-code-kata-series/">previous posts</a>, I explained how to use the 20 hours of Code Katas technique to learn new languages. If you did not read these yet, start by <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-learn-a-programming-language-in-just-20-hours/">the beginning</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-03-26-frequently-asked-questions-about-the-20-hours-of-code-katas/faq-bulb.jpg" alt="A drawing of FAQ in a lightbulb" /></p>

<p>To close <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/20-hours-code-kata-series/">this series</a>, here are a few tips and suggestions presented as questions and answers.</p>

<h2>What if you don&rsquo;t know TDD yet ?</h2>

<p>The few <a href="http://codingdojo.org/dojo/ParisDojo/">Parisian guys</a> who invented the Coding Dojo wanted to teach and spread TDD ! You should have no problem to use it to learn TDD yourself !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 The coding dojo was invented to teach and spread TDD</p></blockquote>

<p>Pick your favorite language, and schedule a kata plan to practice TDD. Watch one or two <a href="https://www.google.fr/search?q=code+kata&amp;tbm=vid">videos</a> to see how gurus are doing it. At first, you&rsquo;ll have to be very careful to stick to baby steps and the red-green-refactor loop. If you need help, check <a href="https://www.meetup.com">meetup.com</a> for local coding dojos where you&rsquo;ll find help.</p>

<h2>Can I apply this technique to learn something else than a new language ?</h2>

<p>As you might have noticed, I used it to refresh my Javascript. I went on to learn different flavors of JS, but also different test libraries. I&rsquo;ve used in to learn more advanced parts of other languages in the past.</p>

<p>Katas also work well to learn programming techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">DDD</a>. Some nice people shared <a href="http://kata-log.rocks/refactoring">refactoring katas</a> on the web. To practice DDD, we could repeat katas with the constraint of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity">Entities</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object">Value Objects</a> only.</p>

<p>You can even use the technique to learn other things like frameworks or tools, but you&rsquo;ll need to tune it. As I explained before, you need an exercice for deliberate practice and a fast feedback loop. We typically use a Code Katas and TDD for that, but that&rsquo;s not the only options. Whenever you can find a way to deliberately practice with a fast feedback loop, you&rsquo;re ready to go ! These days, we should look for docker images with frameworks and tools pre-installed. Going through tutorials without looking at the solutions is deliberate practice. A small live environment can give us fast enough feedback.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Find Deliberate Practice exercices and a fast feedback loop for efficient learning</p></blockquote>

<h2>What if I don&rsquo;t find any kata ?</h2>

<p>Build one yourself ! I&rsquo;m not joking, building a kata, especially one where you start from scratch is not too difficult. Inspiration comes from anything you happen to do in your daily work. Trim down a programming challenge you had to work, and you might have a kata ! Went to a programming interview ? The question you had to answer might do a nice kata.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-03-26-frequently-asked-questions-about-the-20-hours-of-code-katas/make-things-happen.jpg" alt="&quot;Make things happen&quot; written on a blackboard" /></p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve created and tested your kata, share it ! There are online kata repositories where you could get a chance to publish it.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://codingdojo.org/">codingdojo.org</a></li>
<li>  <a href="http://cyber-dojo.org/">cyber-dojo.org</a></li>
<li>  <a href="http://kata-log.rocks">kata-log.rocks</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>One last thing</h2>

<p>I just remembered I did not finish <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-learn-a-programming-language-in-just-20-hours/">my story about my Javascript kata plan</a>. For those wondering, here is the end of story. In the end I did not join this team to do Javascript coaching. After thinking through it for a while, I decided to stop the katas there, and move to something else. I was only 6 hours in, and what was the point to study Javascript not to use it straight away ? The day I&rsquo;ll need it, I&rsquo;m likely to have forgotten 80% of it and some of it will be outdated. The knowledge is only another 20 hours away anyway !</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what we could call &ldquo;Just In Time Learning&rdquo; ! We are drowning in knowledge nowadays. It&rsquo;s better to have a fast and effective way to learn anything than trying to know everything.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-learn-a-programming-language-in-just-20-hours/">previous post</a>, I described how I&rsquo;ve been using 20 hours of Code Katas to learn new languages. If you did not read it yet, have a look at it first. Let&rsquo;s now look at why it works so well.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-20-Hours-Learn-Anything/dp/1591846943/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521785371&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+first+20+hours">The First 20 Hours</a> Josh Kaufman explains how he learned <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> in 20 hours. He did not become a Ruby expert, but he was able to build and maintain a static website generator. For my part, I have succeeded to learn <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-i-got-my-feet-wet-with-machine-learning-with-the-first-20-hours/">a bit of machine learning</a> using the 20 hours technique.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of the 20 hours of Code Katas relies a few key points.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-03-26-why-20-hours-of-code-kata-are-so-effective-for-learning-new-languages/why.jpg" alt="Drawing of &quot;Why ?&quot; mixed up with the inside of a clock" /></p>

<h2>Time-boxing</h2>

<p>Time-boxing has 2 main benefits. First, it forces us to stick to what is the most important for us to learn. There is no time to waste slacking around in only 20 hours. Plus it&rsquo;s a lot easier to focus for 20 hours than over a very long period of time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a second great thing about time-boxing. The further you go, the less remains to do, and the less likely you are to drop the effort ! We are a lot less likely to abandon when we know we only need a few hours to finish the goal we had set to ourselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Time-boxing creates focus</p></blockquote>

<h2>A plan</h2>

<p>Again, the plan helps us to focus. We&rsquo;ll need to choose what gets in a 20 hours plan. Building the plan itself forces us to get a grasp of the learning space. This will help to pick the good stuff to practice.</p>

<h2>Routine</h2>

<p>Routine is a magic trick to get things done. Once we have a routine in place, we don&rsquo;t have to think or do extra efforts to find time to learn. The time is already there, we just have to use it !</p>

<h2>Deliberate practice</h2>

<p>Some exemples from &ldquo;The first 20 hours&rdquo; highlight the benefits of deliberate practice. When learning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak">Colemak keyboard</a>, the author went through typing exercices. When studying the game of Go, he did practices specific situation puzzles. In both cases, deliberate practice made him learn faster. Code katas are typical deliberate practice exercices for programmers.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-03-26-why-20-hours-of-code-kata-are-so-effective-for-learning-new-languages/golf-practice.jpg" alt="Picture of a golfer deliberately practicing" /></p>

<h2>Test Driven Development</h2>

<p><a href="http://codingdojo.org/">Coding Dojos</a> are the programmers&#8217; deliberate practice. Coding Dojos traditionally rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>. TDD sets up a fast feedback loop that is key to efficient learning. Think of all the time saved by not having to run and debug a full program every time ! Even dabbling around in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> cannot beat running 20 or so test cases every few seconds.</p>

<h2>We are already programmers</h2>

<p>One last and obvious little detail : we don&rsquo;t have to learn it all ! When the author learned Ruby in 20 hours, he was starting from scratch ! Unlike us, who already know how to program, but want to extend our knowledge to a few more topics. Most of the times, we don&rsquo;t need to relearn everything, but to transpose what we know in a new context.</p>

<p>For example, if we already know an object oriented language, learning a new one will be easier. It&rsquo;s a bit like with foreign languages, the more you know, and the easier it is to learn the next one. In fact, the more languages, frameworks, patterns and paradigms you know, the more the 20 hours code katas will work for you.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 The more you know about software, the easier it will be to learn your next programming language.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We should not panic when asked to work with a new language. We should be bold enough to answer to job openings requiring technologies we are not used to. In one word, we should not be afraid of new techs. Here is why : by scheduling 20 hours of Code Kata routine sessions, we can get a decent level of mastery on most topics.</p>

<h2>How I learned some Haskell</h2>

<p>Quite a few years ago, we used to do weekly <a href="http://codingdojo.org/">Coding Dojos</a> at <a href="https://www.murex.com/">Murex</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_c0d3">Arnaud Bailly</a> was among us, and as he is an <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> fan, we ended up doing quite a lot of katas with Haskell. To my astonishment, after a few sessions, I understood of the fundamentals of the language. Without ever studying it !</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 I learned a lot of Haskell by just going to Coding Dojos !</p></blockquote>

<p>Many times afterwards, I learned new languages quickly by practicing them in the Dojo.</p>

<h2>How I set out to refresh my javascript</h2>

<p>Fast forward to the end of last year. Someone asked me if I could work at coaching a team doing some Javascript. I&rsquo;ve done some Javascript in the past, but my skills definitely needed a serious update. I decided to use Code Katas to refresh my Javascript. To try to make this even more effective, I decided to mix in a bit of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-20-Hours-Learn-Anything/dp/1591846943/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521785371&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+first+20+hours">&ldquo;First 20 hours&rdquo;</a> technique.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-20-Hours-Learn-Anything/dp/1591846943/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521785371&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+first+20+hours"><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-03-23-how-to-learn-a-programming-language-in-just-20-hours/the-first-20-hours.jpg" alt="The cover of the book &quot;The first 20 hours&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>I started by defining a plan of 10 sessions of 2 hours long code katas :</p>

<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/">Roman Numeral</a> &ndash; <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> &ndash; JS 5</li>

<li>Median of a list of lists &ndash; <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> &ndash; <a href="http://es6-features.org/">ES 6</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/NumberToLCD/">LCD Numbers</a> &ndash; <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> &ndash; <a href="http://es6-features.org/">ES 6</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/Potter/">Kata Potter</a> &ndash; <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> &ndash; <a href="http://es6-features.org/">ES 6</a></li>

<li><a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/PokerHands/">Poker hand</a> &ndash; <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> &ndash; <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a></li>

</ol>


<p>The plan felt pretty ambitious at the beginning. The first session was a bit hectic as I struggled to find a quick setup I could use to code my kata in. After only 3 sessions though, I could feel I&rsquo;d already made a lot of progress. I had become confident I would get most of the plan done in 20 hours.</p>

<h2>How to start ?</h2>

<p>A good thing about the 20 hours technique is that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to start with ! There&rsquo;s a catch though ! At the start, it&rsquo;s puzzling to be on your own with no clear track on how to tackle the topic. Here is the fix : start anyway, stick through, and you&rsquo;ll work it out 99% of the time.</p>

<p>Here is, in more details, how to use code kata with the 20 hours technique :</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by setting up a routine. It could be 2 hours at lunch time, 1 hour in the morning or 3 hours at night. Do whatever is best for you. It should be enough to finish in a few days or weeks.</li>
<li>Use the first hours of your 20 hours to setup a code kata plan. It might be very fast if you already have an idea of your learning space. It will take longer if you are a complete newbie. Skim through the literature for the main concepts until you have a plan. Try to keep this phase under 6 hours, otherwise you won&rsquo;t have any time left for actual learning.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> plays a key role in fast learning ! Next step is to setup a development environment with TDD to use in your Code Kata sessions.</li>
<li>Finally, do you code kata sessions. Time-box them for something less than 2 hours and run a mini-retrospective at the end of every session. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to adapt your plan if it makes sense.</li>
<li>When you reach 20 hours of learning, stop your sessions. It will be time to think a bit about what you accomplished.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>💡 TDD plays a key role in fast learning.</p></blockquote>

<p>If all went well, you should have learned quite a lot in only 20 hours. At that point, it&rsquo;s up to you to decide what to do next. You can either decide to dig deeper. In this case, setup a new run of 20 hours of code katas ! It could also be a good time to read a bit of theory about what you just learned. Casting a different light on the topic will make it stick and deepen your understanding. Otherwise, you could stop there and start whatever is on your mind. I don&rsquo;t recommend continuing on the same topic without rethinking a new plan though. That would kill your focus and be a less efficient use of your time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve read my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/team-randori-series/">previous posts about Team Randori Coding Dojos</a>, you should know why and how to run a successful one.</p>

<p>Did you manage to setup the team <a href="http://codingdojo.org/RandoriKata/">Randori coding dojo</a> as a recurring event ? Congratulations ! Your team is on the road to continuous learning and improvement. To close this series of posts, here are battle tested tricks for greatest impact. Let&rsquo;s boost your teamwork, your production code and a few other things.</p>

<h2>Boost your teamwork</h2>

<p>I stated <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/why-you-should-start-a-team-coding-dojo-randori-right-now/">before</a> that the team Randori is a perfect occasion to improve your teamwork. By itself, just doing it will already take you a long way towards better collaboration. As instigator of the coding dojo though, you can push the topic faster and further.</p>

<h3>Coding and Design Conventions</h3>

<p>Whenever you see the opportunity during the dojo, raise design discussions. It&rsquo;s a good way to share best practices. It often ends up in new coding conventions for the team.</p>

<p>Also don&rsquo;t forget to use the retrospective. It&rsquo;s the perfect time to agree on best practices for the dojo <em>and</em> for production code. Push people to dig into what they are mentioning. Ask them if they are willing to adhere to a particular practice. You can use <a href="http://www.plays-in-business.com/thumb-voting/">thumb vote</a> to get a quick agreement. Once the team agrees on something, record it somewhere and make sure it is visible to everyone.</p>

<h3>Egoless Programming</h3>

<p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/">Egoless Programming</a> makes collaboration a lot easier within a team. In the dojo, demonstrate Egoless Programming yourself. In particular if you already enjoy good peer recognition, adopt a &ldquo;low attitude&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to encourage others to delete your code when they have a better idea. Yourself, don&rsquo;t hesitate to delete code if it makes sense, but don&rsquo;t make a fuss about it.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Be a champion of Egoless Programming in Coding Dojo to bring this practice in your team.</p></blockquote>

<p>Be careful if your workplace is too competitive or if your reputation is not yet strong enough. I&rsquo;d go slow on this aspect in such situations.</p>

<p>During the dojo, you might notice people who have difficulties with egoless programming. In this case, remind its principes to everyone and that you are here to learn and practice. You can also mention that this is a TDD exercice and that deleting and changing code is the way to go.</p>

<h2>Going further</h2>

<p>After enough successful sessions, you&rsquo;ll want to push further and experiment new things. Absolutely do it ! There&rsquo;s a lot more to discover about the coding dojos.</p>

<h3>Variations</h3>

<p>You can try new formats like the <a href="http://codingdojo.org/PreparedKata/">Prepared Kata</a> or Randori in Pairs. You can learn a new language by redoing your favorite problems in this language. You can add constraints like &ldquo;No If&rdquo;, &ldquo;Always Compiles&rdquo; or even exotic things like &ldquo;No Heap Allocation&rdquo;. You might also give <a href="https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook">Emily Bache&rsquo;s book</a> a read for tons of others ideas.</p>

<h3>Production code</h3>

<p>If you continue long enough, your team will get particularly good at Randoris. At that point, you might wonder how you could apply this to production code ? It turns you can !</p>

<p>One way I found, which I wrote about in <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/why-you-should-start-a-team-coding-dojo-randori-right-now/">my first post</a>, is to try to fix a local smell or static analysis issue in the code. Get all the team to do a Randori to fix that, discuss the design and conventions, and commit at the end of the session.</p>

<p>Particularly difficult legacy code refactorings are also pretty good candidates for Randoris. </p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law">Linus&rsquo;s Law</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Once you are there, you might altogether jump into mob programming ! Randoris are by nature, like timeboxed mobs. Replace the Randori rule &ldquo;Driver decides what to code&rdquo; with <a href="https://code.joejag.com/2018/three-constraints-for-mobbing.html">Strong Style pairing</a> (Make the driver code your idea) and that&rsquo;s it, you are a mob !</p>

<h2>Spread the word</h2>

<p>One last thing before closing this series on team coding dojos. If the practice is useful to your team, spread it. Chances are that there are other development teams working next to you. Invite members of other teams to your dojo. This will build up their envy for their own team coding dojo. Propose your help to boot their first session !</p>

<p>In the long run, the improved practices of this team might benefit you ! For example, if your teams start collaborating. Or perhaps you&rsquo;ll join this team some day !</p>

<p>Whatever happens, I wish you a lot of fun in your teams Coding Dojos. Happy Coding !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my last 2 blog posts, I&rsquo;ve detailed <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/why-you-should-start-a-team-coding-dojo-randori-right-now/">why</a> and <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-start-a-team-coding-dojo-randori-today/">how</a> to start a team Randori Coding Dojo. That&rsquo;s the easy part. As soon as you start your first dojo, you&rsquo;ll face trickier issues, especially people issues.</p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-03-08-coding-dojo-troubleshooting/tool-belt.jpg" alt="A martial artist with a tool belt" /></p>

<h2>What if my team (or my boss) does not want to ?</h2>

<p>Very often some of your team mates won&rsquo;t see the value of the coding dojo upfront and will prefer to work on other tasks. It can also be your boss, who thinks you should be delivering features instead. Here are a few tricks you can do to make it work.</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to find another time slot. Ask people for their preferred moment. If you can negotiate food sponsorship with your boss, you might get everyone happy. He won&rsquo;t feel you&rsquo;re not delivering features, you&rsquo;ll have a free lunch and you&rsquo;ll improve your skills.</li>
<li>If your boss or colleague doesn&rsquo;t want to spend 2 full hours on a dojo. Get them to start with smaller problems and a shorter time slot.</li>
<li>Your colleagues might have doubts about the value of the dojo. Get them to try it once or a few times before committing to a recurring event.</li>
<li>As a general rule of thumb, the more you manage to involve people in the preparation, the more they&rsquo;ll adhere.</li>
<li>If you have 1 or 2 inveterate laggards, do it without them anyway. With time, they&rsquo;ll understand what they are missing !</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>💡 If you cannot get people to adopt a new practice, get them to try it once. You&rsquo;ll be more than halfway there.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Dealing with TDD complaints</h2>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2018-03-08-coding-dojo-troubleshooting/skeptic-gorilla.jpg" alt="A gorilla with a skeptic look" /></p>

<p>As you&rsquo;ll start your first Randori, you&rsquo;ll have some complaints about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a>. Whether they come from newbies or skeptics, they usually look like :</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do we stick to TDD ? We&rsquo;d go so much faster if we coded this straight away.</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t need TDD for such a simple problem.</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t need such small baby steps on this simple problem.</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>My answer is more or less always the same. I try to re-frame everyone in the context of a learning exercice of deliberate practice. It could sound something like :</p>

<blockquote><p>Yes, sure. I know you are professional developers and that you could easily solve this little problem. Keep in mind that we are here to deliberately practice TDD and friends. Solving the problem is only a side effect.</p>

<p>We are going to apply TDD by the book, for the sake of learning. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to learn to swim in 1 meter of water than in the middle of the sea. Once we&rsquo;ll master it in the safe dojo environment, you&rsquo;ll know how to adapt it to your production code.</p>

<p>Please, play by the rules here !</p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, I don&rsquo;t try to convince them. The last thing I want is to get into a pro vs cons of TDD. 95% of the time, this answer is enough to get people over their skepticism and try it for the time of the dojo. Unfortunately, the last 5% might result in a difficult session. There&rsquo;s no single way to deal with these 5%. You can try to discuss with them in private, or run next session without them.</p>

<blockquote><p>💡 Reframe the coding dojo as a learning exercice relying on TDD to go beyond skepticism.</p></blockquote>

<h2>How to avoid getting bogged down in details</h2>

<p>One last advice, especially for your first sessions. It&rsquo;s a common rookie mistake to waste 80% of the coding time on error handling. The key is to focus on what you want to learn. You are not writing production code, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to omit certain aspects. For example, assume that correct arguments are provided to skip error handling. This will save you time, be more fun and increase what you learn.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next ?</h2>

<p>This was part 3 of this <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/team-randori-series/">series on team coding dojo</a>. In <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-get-the-max-out-of-your-team-coding-dojo/">the next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll write how to maximize the benefits we can get out of coding dojos.</p>
