    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/philou/planning_poker">My current side project</a> is an online tool to do remote planning pokers. I followed my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-boot-a-new-rails-project-with-docker-and-heroku/">previous tutorial</a> to setup Rails, Docker and Heroku.</p>

<p>Naturally, as a BDD proponent, I tried to install <a href="https://cucumber.io">cucumber</a> to write my first scenario.</p>

<p>Here is the result of my first cucumber run :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>docker-compose run shell bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>cucumber
</span><span class='line'>rails aborted!
</span><span class='line'>PG::ConnectionBad: could not translate host name <span class="s2">&quot;postgres://postgres:@herokuPostgresql:5432/postgres&quot;</span> to address: Name or service not known
</span><span class='line'>...
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It turned out that I had taken instructions from a <a href="https://blog.codeship.com/deploying-docker-rails-app/">blog article on codeship</a> that mistakenly used <code>host:</code> instead of <code>url:</code> in their <code>config/database.yml</code></p>

<p>After fixing that in my database.yml file, things where only slightly working better :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>: DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS <span class="s2">&quot;postgres&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The thing is the config was still using the same database for all environments. That&rsquo;s not exactly what I wanted. I updated my <code>config/database.yml</code> :</p>

<h2>Fixing rake db:create</h2>

<p>By searching through the web, I found that people were having similar issues with rake db:create. I tried to run it and here is what I got :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>Database <span class="s1">&#39;planning_poker_test&#39;</span> already exists
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Why is it trying to create the postgres database ? It turns out that the DATABASE_URL takes precedence over what is defined in my <code>config/database.yml</code>. I need to unset this variable locally. I already have the <code>docker-compose.override.yml</code> for that :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Rake db:create works just fine now :</p>

<h2>Starting a psql session</h2>

<p>During all my trouble-shootings, I tried to connect to the Postgresql server to make sure that the databases where created and ready. Here is how I managed to do that :</p>

<h3>1. Install psql client</h3>

<p>On my Ubuntu machine, that was a simple <code>sudo apt-get install postgresql-client-9.4</code>.</p>

<h3>2. Finding the server port</h3>

<p>The port can be found through <code>config/database.yml</code> or through <code>docker ps</code>. Let&rsquo;s use the later, as we&rsquo;ll need it to find the server IP as well.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>docker ps
</span><span class='line'>CONTAINER ID        IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS           NAMES
</span><span class='line'>b58ce42d2b2b        postgres         <span class="s2">&quot;/docker-entrypoint.s&quot;</span>   46 hours ago        Up 46 hours         5432/tcp        planningpoker_herokuPostgresql_1
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here the port is clearly 5432.</p>

<h3>3. Finding the server IP</h3>

<p>Using the container id we got on previous <code>docker ps</code> command, we can use <code>docker inspect</code> to get further details :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>docker inspect b58ce42d2b2b | grep IPAddress
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="s2">&quot;SecondaryIPAddresses&quot;</span>: null,
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="s2">&quot;IPAddress&quot;</span>: <span class="s2">&quot;172.17.0.2&quot;</span>,
</span><span class='line'>                    <span class="s2">&quot;IPAddress&quot;</span>: <span class="s2">&quot;172.17.0.2&quot;</span>,
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>4. Connecting to the database</h3>

<p>Connecting is now just a matter of filling the command line.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">psql</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">U</span> <span class="n">postgres</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="mi">5432</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">d</span> <span class="n">planning_poker_development</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="mi">172</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">17</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">2</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">planning_poker_development</span><span class="o">=#</span> <span class="k">select</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">schema_migrations</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="k">version</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">---------</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="k">rows</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>5. Installing psql client directly in the shell</h3>

<p>It should be possible to install the psql client in the shell container automatically, but I must admit I did not try this yet. It should just a matter of adding this to the <code>Dockerfile</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="n">RUN</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">get</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">postgresql</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">client</span><span class="o">-&lt;</span><span class="k">version</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-boot-a-new-rails-project-with-docker-and-heroku</id>
    <category term="docker" /><category term="heroku" /><category term="rails" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, I used <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> to deploy my <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses">side-project</a>. It provides great service, but I remember that updates to the Heroku Stack was a nightmare &hellip; Versions of the OS (and nearly everything) changed. The migration was a matter of days, and while doing a side-project, this was difficult. At the time, I remember thinking that using branches and VMs would have been the solution.</p>

<p>Now that I started to use Heroku again, I decided to use <a href="http://www.docker.com">Docker</a> from the beginning. More specifically, I am expecting :</p>

<ul>
<li>to have a minimal setup on my host machine</li>
<li>to use the same infrastructure in dev than in production</li>
<li>to simplify switching to a new machine</li>
<li>to simplify the migration to the next Heroku stack</li>
</ul>


<p>As an added benefit, if ever someone else joins me in my side-project, it will be a matter of minutes before we can all work on the same infrastructure !</p>

<p>Heroku provides a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/local-development-with-docker">tutorial</a> about how to deploy an existing <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> app to heroku using containers. Unfortunately, I did yet have an existing rails app &hellip; So the first challenge I faced, was how to create a Rails app without actually installing Rails on my machine. The trick is to bootstrap rails in docker itself before packaging all this for Heroku.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-07-13-how-to-boot-a-new-rails-project-with-docker-and-heroku/logos.jpg" title="The 3 logos of Rails, Docker and Heroku" ></p>

<h2>1. Install the required software</h2>

<p>I installed only 4 things on my host machine
&ndash; Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/">instructions</a>
&ndash; Docker Compose <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">instructions</a>
&ndash; Heroku Toolbelt <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/">instructions</a>
&ndash; Heroku container plugin <code>heroku plugins:install heroku-container-tools</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all I changed to my host machine.</p>

<h2>2. Setup docker</h2>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s create a new dir and step into it. Run :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd </span>docker-rails-heroku
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To prepare the Heroku setup, create a <code>Procfile</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>web: bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>puma -C config/puma.rb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and <code>app.json</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='json'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&quot;name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Docker Rails Heroku&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&quot;description&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;An example app.json for container-deploy&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To generate docker files for Heroku, run :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>heroku container:init
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You want to run Rails in dev mode locally, so we need to override Heroku&rsquo;s default env (<a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/docker-compose-trick-how-to-have-an-overridable-environment-variable-in-development-mode/">Check my previous post for details</a>)</p>

<p>Create an <code>.env</code> file</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2>3. Create the Rails app</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s now time to follow <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/rails/">the official docker-compose rails tutorial</a> to bootstrap the rails app and directories :</p>

<p>Change <code>Dockerfile</code> to</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># FROM heroku/ruby</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">FROM ruby:2.2.0</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">RUN apt-get update -qq &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y build-essential libpq-dev nodejs</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">ADD . /myapp</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Create a bootstrap <code>Gemfile</code> with the content</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">source</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://rubygems.org&#39;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Bundle install within the container requires a existing <code>Gemfile.lock</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># Create an empty Gemfile.lock</span>
</span><span class='line'>touch Gemfile.lock
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s now time to build your docker container to be able to run rails and generate your source files. Run the following :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># Build your containers</span>
</span><span class='line'>docker-compose build
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Run rails within the shell container and generate rails files</span>
</span><span class='line'>docker-compose run shell bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>rails new . --force --database<span class="o">=</span>postgresql --skip-bundle
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Unfortunately, rails is ran as root inside the container. We can change ownership and rights with this command :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># Change ownership</span>
</span><span class='line'>sudo chown -R <span class="nv">$USER</span>:<span class="nv">$USER</span> .
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Change rights</span>
</span><span class='line'>sudo chmod -R ug+rw .
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>4. Make it Heroku ready</h2>

<p>Now that the rails files are generated, It&rsquo;s time to replace the bootstrap settings with real Heroku Dockerfile</p>

<p>Revert <code>Dockerfile</code> to simply :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>FROM heroku/ruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Heroku uses <a href="http://puma.io/">Puma</a> so we need to add it to our <code>Gemfile</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># Use Puma as the app server</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;puma&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;~&gt; 3.0&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We also need to add a config file for Puma. Create <code>config/puma.rb</code> with this content (you can check <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-rails-applications-with-the-puma-web-server#adding-puma-to-your-application">heroku doc</a> for details)</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It should now be possible to rebuild the container, and run the app :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Start the rails app using the web container</span>
</span><span class='line'>docker-compose up web
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The app should be accessible at <a href="http://0.0.0.0:8080">http://0.0.0.0:8080</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-07-13-how-to-boot-a-new-rails-project-with-docker-and-heroku/rails-homepage.jpg" title="The default homepage for a new Rails application" ></p>

<h2>5. Deploying to heroku</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re almost ready to deploy to heroku.</p>

<p>First, we need to exclude development files from our image. For this, we need to create a <code>.dockerignore</code> file with the content</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>.git*
</span><span class='line'>db/*.sqlite3
</span><span class='line'>db/*.sqlite3-journal
</span><span class='line'>log/*
</span><span class='line'>tmp/*
</span><span class='line'>Dockerfile
</span><span class='line'>.env
</span><span class='line'>docker-compose.yml
</span><span class='line'>docker-compose.override.yml
</span><span class='line'>README.rdoc
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s then classic Heroku deploy commands :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># create an Heroku app</span>
</span><span class='line'>heroku apps:create &lt;your-app-name&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># And deploy to it</span>
</span><span class='line'>heroku container:release --app &lt;your-app-name&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Your app should be accessible on line at <a href="https://">https://</a>&lt;your-app-name>.herokuapp.com/</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-07-13-how-to-boot-a-new-rails-project-with-docker-and-heroku/deployed-to-heroku.jpg" title="The typical error message when you deploy a new Rails app to heroku" ></p>

<p>Rails does not provide a default homepage in production. But you can check the logs with</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>heroku logs --app &lt;your-app-name&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>6. Running commands</h2>

<p>When in development mode, you might want to run rails or other commands on your source code again. The shell container exists just for that, run <code>docker-compose run shell ...</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># For example, to update your bundle</span>
</span><span class='line'>docker-compose run shell bundle update
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>EDIT 2016-07-20</h3>

<p>For the moment, there&rsquo;s a catch with bundle install or update commands, as the gems are installed outside the shared volume, only Gemfile.lock will be updated, which required to run docker-compose build again &hellip; I&rsquo;ll have a look into this later and see if I can fix that.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>docker-compose run shell bundle update
</span><span class='line'>docker-compose build
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <category term="docker" /><category term="heroku" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently been playing with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> while starting <a href="https://github.com/philou/planning-poker">my new side project</a>. I&rsquo;ve fallen into a situation where my production container uses a value for an environment variable, but while developing, I&rsquo;ll need both a different default and the ability to override this value.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and found various references about how to deploy Rails app using Docker, but in the end, I decided to use <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> which handles a lot of ops for me. Rails uses the RAILS_ENV environment variable to know if it&rsquo;s going to run in development, test or production mode. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/ruby/">heroku/ruby</a> image sets <code>RAILS_ENV=production</code>, but we usually want to use <code>RAILS_ENV=development</code> locally. I could have overridden RAILS_ENV in a docker-compose.override.yml file, but that would prevent me from running my app in production locally.</p>

<h2>The trick</h2>

<p>I eventually fixed my issue with combination of 2 files.</p>

<h3>docker-compose.override.yml</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">RAILS_ENV</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;${RAILS_ENV}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nn">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>.env</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">RAILS_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>development
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>The logs</h3>

<p>My app starts in development mode by default :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>

</span><span class='line'>web_1               | Use Ctrl-C to stop
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-years-of-blogging-about-software</id>
    <category term="blogging" /><category term="career" /><category term="octopress" /><category term="software" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>5 years ago, I started blogging. I started really casually, my posts were personal reminders and notes rather than real well thought of articles. Nevertheless, it did me great good :</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been invited to talk at meetups</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve had the joy of seeing some articles being tweeted many times</li>
<li>I received interesting job offers from all over the world</li>
</ul>


<p>6 months ago, after reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467000033&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=soft+skills">Soft Skills: The software developer&rsquo;s life manual</a>, I set up the practice of writing at least one article per week, and here is my (very encouraging) graph of sessions since then:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-06-27-5-years-of-blogging-about-software/analytics.jpg" title="The steadily increase curve of the sessions on my blog per month" ></p>

<h1>Excuses Why Not To Blog</h1>

<p>Here is a collection of the (bad) excuses you&rsquo;ll often hear people say for not blogging :</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t know how to write &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Blogging regularly is actually a pretty good way to improve your writing skills. As usual, the key is to fake it until you make it.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m not into this social media stuff &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to share anything personal on your software blog. In the end, your blog is a professional tool.</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t have anything interesting to say &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>They are others in the same situation as you who would like to see more posts about the kind of uninteresting things you just discovered. Wouldn’t you have liked someone to have written the newby article about « how to do XXX » you just spent 3 days to crack ?</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t have the time &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Make it ! Time is never found, it is made. In the end, it’s just a matter of prioritization.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are other totally valid reasons why not to blog, but I&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;re able to recognize those.</p>

<h1>Why Would You Blog ?</h1>

<p>On the other side, if you jump into blogging, you can expect a lot of returns :</p>

<ul>
<li>First thing is that you&rsquo;ll obviously gain more visibility. I&rsquo;ve got readers from all over the world, and my articles are sometimes re-tweeted many times.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll improve your writing skills. Writing skills turn out to be unexpectedly important for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M">software writers</a> !</li>
<li>In order to lay down your ideas about something, you&rsquo;ll need to dig a bit more into. It is said to be the last step to learning.</li>
<li>It can act as a personal documentation. I used to write mine as a how-to notepad on which I could refer later on.</li>
<li>If you have a day job, you can re-post your articles there. You should gain extra visibility and expose the company to new ideas.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How to start</h1>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve decided that you want to blog, starting should not be an issue.</p>

<h2>Pick a platform</h2>

<p>There are a lot of blogging platforms out there. For programmers, I would recommend a few though :</p>

<p>Then, it&rsquo;s up to you !</p>

<h2>Start with how-to articles</h2>

<p>When I started my blog, it was mostly has a personal how-to reference. It allowed me to come back to it and find out how I did something last time. I thought that if it was important to me, it must be important to others as-well !</p>

<h2>Blog regularly</h2>

<p>Blogging every week made a huge difference to me. My traffic went from erratic to steadily increasing. I am currently observing a 11% traffic increase per month. This means that it nearly quadruples every year : I&rsquo;m not going to stop now !</p>

<h2>Integrate with the web</h2>

<p>This boils down to social networks and analytics. Obviously, you&rsquo;ll want to use Google Analytics to see how people are reading your content. I&rsquo;m using the venerable <a href="https://feedburner.google.com">Feedburner</a> to automatically post my new articles on <a href="https://twitter.com">twitter</a>. There&rsquo;s an option to use your post categories as hashtags, be sure to make it works, it brings a lot of traffic.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all up to you now !</p>

    <updated>2016-06-08T04:45:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/the-size-of-code</id>
    <category term="joke" /><category term="programming" /><category term="technical-debt" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The CFO&rsquo;s debt is visible in his balance sheet. The CTO&rsquo;s technical debt is invisible. What about making it visible ?</p>

<p>Developers have an intuitive sense of the technical debt in some parts of the system. But few have an accurate estimation of its full extent. Even the size of a code base is difficult to grasp. In the same way, the size of the code is just a number. But the fact are there : between 10 000 and 10 000 000 lines of code, the rules aren&rsquo;t the same, but it&rsquo;s only invisible data on hard drives &hellip;</p>

<h2>Showing It</h2>

<p>If we had a device or a trick to show to non-developers the size of the source code, people might start to feel the embarrassment of working in a bloated code base. Unfortunately, for the moment, the only ideas I had are somehow unrealistic, albeit funny !</p>

<h3>First Idea : Printouts</h3>

<p>Suppose we printed all the source code every Monday, and then keep it around for everyone to feel its size. We could leave it in the middle of the place, or in the CTO&rsquo;s office, so that he&rsquo;d actually be hindered by the space loss. The larger the code, the bigger the troubles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to print 50 lines on a sheet of paper, that&rsquo;s 100 on both sides.
That&rsquo;s 50 000 in a pack of 500 pages. And eventually, 200 000 in this kind of standard case :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-06-08-the-size-of-code/paper-case.jpg" title="A 2000 sheets paper case" ></p>

<p>Keeping these printouts in sync with the real cost would make the thing even more <del>painful</del> realistic. Imagine all the printings costs, and moving around cases of paper every day &hellip; ;)</p>

<h3>Second Idea : Inflatable Device</h3>

<p>What about an inflatable device linked to <a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> (or any other code metrics tracking system) ? It could grow as new code is written. We could make it as large as we want : 1m<sup>3</sup> for every 10K lines of Code, making the whole office a difficult place to walk around. Try to figure out how to work with this thing in the office :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jimmykuehnle.com/artblog/inflatable-bigger-than-the-studio/"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-06-08-the-size-of-code/Large_Inflatable_Art.jpg" title="Large Inflatable Art (Jimmy Kuehnle)" ></a></p>

<h3>Third Idea : Sand</h3>

<p>For maximum pain, let&rsquo;s use real sand instead of an inflatable device ! Imagine the mess with some sand lying around in the office. If the only way to clean up the mess was to clean up the code, surely everyone would take the issue seriously !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-06-08-the-size-of-code/sand-pile.jpg" title="A sand pile on the pavement" ></p>

<h2>Final Word</h2>

<p>Obviously, these are jokes, but I guess there&rsquo;s a real need there. If we managed to make non developers feel the size and cost of the code base, it would be easier to agree on priorities.</p>

<p>Some days, coding feels like speleology or mining &hellip; Dealing with weird and undocumented old logic can even some time be <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-keep-your-sanity-while-working-on-a-Super-Dirty-Rotten-Spaghetti-codebase">damaging to the mind</a> ! I think we should go to work wearing the adequate protection !</p>

<p>OK, maybe we cannot start to go to work wearing a coverall everyday, but let&rsquo;s say very 21st of June is now legacy code day, the day when every developer maintaining legacy code comes to work dressed like that !</p>

<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s a joke, but it could attract the attention of other non-coding people on the state of <em>their</em> codebase and amount of <em>their</em> technical debt.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I started to program professionally 15 years ago, a lot of things have changes. A lot of technologies appeared and became mainstream while others fell out of fashion.</p>

<p>As software developers, it is really challenging to stay fit and productive in new technologies. I cannot obviously say that I am an expert in all new technologies, but I can say that I can get up to speed in a pretty short time in nearly all.</p>

<p>If there is a single reason for that I strongly believe it is because &ldquo;I studied my classics&rdquo; !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-30-how-to-keep-up-with-software-technologies/outdated.jpg" title="An outdated computed covered in spider webs" ></p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

<p>At the same time I started to program all day long for my living, I also started to read a lot of programming books on my spare time. This allowed me to learn at night and practice at day, setting everything in my brain.</p>

<p>This might come as a surprise, but I never read a lot of books about the technologies I was using. I&rsquo;d rather study fundamental programming books. These contain a lot of transportable knowledge, unlike in most books about a particular technology.</p>

<p>I believe this is a pretty good use of time since it made me a better programmer and also greatly reduced the time I need to master most new technologies. I can now easily relate them to some more general concept I learned before.</p>

<p>For example, I never read a book about UI. By the time I had to do some UI programming, I had absolutely no issue getting up to speed on the topic. I had already seen quite some UI code examples in other books, I knew that most UI frameworks are built from a set of Object Oriented patterns. Coming from a different perspective, I was even able to suggest improvements to the code that UI experts had not thought of.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that I never read books about a particular technology, sometimes, that&rsquo;s just what you need to start something new. But when I do, I usually find them quite easy to read and digest. And I tend to skip things I intuitively understand and use them as cookbooks containing recipes for particular problems rather than end to end walk-through.</p>

<h2>My books</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464666382&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+pragmatic+programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464666382&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+pragmatic+programmer"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-30-how-to-keep-up-with-software-technologies/the-pragmatic-programmer.jpg" title="Cover of the pragmatic programmer book" ></a></p>

<p>As a young programmer this book made me understand that my job was not only about writing code, but about building maintainable systems. It provided me with tools to do so, 10 years later, I can still remember &ldquo;The power of plain text&rdquo;. This is also the book that made me have a first look into Ruby :).</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464666776&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=refactoring+improving+the+design+of+existing+code">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464666776&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=refactoring+improving+the+design+of+existing+code"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-30-how-to-keep-up-with-software-technologies/refactoring.jpg" title="Cover of the refactoring book" ></a></p>

<p>Here is the theory behind all automated IDE refactorings. Reading this book had a profound influence on my coding style. The examples made me understand the difference between readable and unreadable code &hellip; It&rsquo;s also the foundation for any kind of incremental design and architecture. That&rsquo;s the book that got me started with TDD.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464666833&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=domain+driven+design+eric+evans">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a></h3>

<p>This book teaches good object oriented programming. Some say it is tough to read, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth doing so. Among other things, it explains how to use functional programming concept in your object oriented project, by separating Value Objects and Entities for example.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=pd_sim_14_2?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=41qX6YdIJ7L&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR122%2C160_&amp;refRID=035C81Y95A0A1C6K25F6">The C Programming Language</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=pd_sim_14_2?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=41qX6YdIJ7L&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR122%2C160_&amp;refRID=035C81Y95A0A1C6K25F6"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-30-how-to-keep-up-with-software-technologies/c.jpg" title="Cover of the C book" ></a></p>

<p>With around 250 pages, it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to find a programming book with a greater value/page ratio. This one will teach you all there is to learn about C, and help you understand everything that was built on top of C (and that&rsquo;s quite a lot &hellip;)</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464666981&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sicp">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464666981&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sicp"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-30-how-to-keep-up-with-software-technologies/sicp.jpg" title="Cover of the SICP book" ></a></p>

<p>Compared to C, Lisp is at the other side of the language spectrum. Learning C and Lisp gives the ability to put nearly anything in contrast to these 2 languages. Lisp is dynamic, functional and meta. It can be morphed into nearly anything and SICP teaches how to do so. There&rsquo;s a Lisp practice that is invaluable to any programmer : use your language to express your problem as simply as possible. SICP teaches that.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Erlang-Concurrent-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193778553X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464667113&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=erlang+programming">Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Erlang-Concurrent-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193778553X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464667113&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=erlang+programming"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-30-how-to-keep-up-with-software-technologies/erlang.jpg" title="Cover of the Erlang book" ></a></p>

<p>Neither the C book nor SICP deals with distribution and concurrency. That&rsquo;s what this book does. I had never programmed distributed systems before reading this book. After I read it, I learned how to code for distribution in a maintainable way. The lessons taught by Erlang are applicable in many languages.</p>

<h2>Not the best books</h2>

<p>I did not and will never read all programming books available. There might be newer books that treat the same subjects better, but these books are the ones that taught me the most about our craft. My point is that learning fundamentals and things far away from our daily technologies will teach us more.</p>

    <category term="complexity" /><category term="software" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With time, I discovered a way of explaining the subtleties of my developer job to my uninformed relatives and friends.</p>

<p>Sharing what your developer job is about with others can be very frustrating. Some people think you are &ldquo;Just playing around with computers&rdquo; as if it was not serious work. Others think that it is an extremely Cartesian and solitary activity with no place for communication or creativity. Trying to explain the diversity and richness of a developer&rsquo;s work is often a disappointing experience.</p>

<h2>The book metaphor</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-23-software-is-like-writing-and-revising-a-giant-book/book.jpg" title="An old book" ></p>

<p>I explain to people that writing software is not unlike writing a huge book. A book long many millions of lines. I explain that the challenge is to maintain the whole story of the book coherent. I stress how difficult this is given that no one can take the time to read the full book, that the authors come and go, and that the book is under constant heavy revision.</p>

<h2>Details of our work</h2>

<p>The metaphor is quite valid and even holds about more subtle aspects of our work. Here is a summary of the last discussion I had about the book metaphor :</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>(Him) Do you have some &lsquo;gatekeepers&rsquo; for different sections of the story to make sure that these parts remain coherent ?</li>
<li>(Me) That&rsquo;s what we would call strong code ownership, this was the norm 20 years ago, but that the industry is moving to more collective code ownership, in order to decrease the bus factor.</li>
<li>(Him) What is the bus factor ?</li>
<li>(Me) The number of person who need to be hit by a bus to block your development progress</li>
<li>(Him) I see, that&rsquo;s kind of funny. But then, does that mean that any developer can change any part of the code ? Isn&rsquo;t that dangerous ?</li>
<li>(Me) Sure that would be difficult, that&rsquo;s not really how we do it. We make a lot of efforts to split the big story in many smaller independent ones as much as possible. This way, teams specialize on different &lsquo;chapters&rsquo; and work collectively within it.</li>
<li>(Him) I see</li>
<li>(Me) And if you need to change something in another &lsquo;chapter&rsquo; you should ask the guys who know it better to help you.</li>
<li>(Him) That makes sense. And what happens if two developers want to modify the same part of the story at the same time</li>
<li>(Me) That can happen. People might even want to modify the story in conflicting ways ! We&rsquo;ve got tools, processes and best practices to minimize this. If nothing is done, we&rsquo;ll get what we call a &lsquo;merge conflict&rsquo;.</li>
<li>(Him) Ho &hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed, but it seems collaboration is really important in your work, isn&rsquo;t it ?</li>
<li>(Me) Sure it is !</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>We are software writers</h2>

<p>All this reminds me of DHH&rsquo;s talk about writing software :</p>

<p>I had been switching to <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> in <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to host my Octopress installation, but that did not seem related &hellip;</p>

<h2>Plan A : Upgrade Octopress</h2>

<p>It turned out it was related to my migration to Vagrant and Docker.xs This kind of nasty error often comes from obsolete environment. <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1173">Internet confirmed</a> confirmed it :</p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu now uses Python3 instead of Python2</li>
<li>Octopress2 uses an old version of Pygments</li>
<li>That version of Pygments requires Python2</li>
</ul>


<p>I thought that I did not want to play <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/ruby-thirdparties-best-practices/">this game</a> against open source libs, so I set out to update. Octopress 3 has been released. It&rsquo;s not yet documented yet, and there is no official upgrade guide, but some guys have done it :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://samwize.com/2015/09/30/migrating-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/">http://samwize.com/2015/09/30/migrating-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dgmstuart.github.io/blog/2016/01/22/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-3/">http://dgmstuart.github.io/blog/2016/01/22/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-3/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.justinrummel.com/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/">https://www.justinrummel.com/migrating-from-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I tried it &hellip; but I stopped before the end. It&rsquo;s kind of working, but fundamental features like category archives required too much Jekylling for me at the time. And themes are still an issue &hellip; I mean, stock theme uses a clean and simple gem based update workflow, but most other themes rely on a tricky git clone-merge update workflow.</p>

<h2>Plan B : Find a hosted blog engine for hackers</h2>

<p>I found quite a few options :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> Looks cool, but there is no simple migration tool, and I&rsquo;ve been burned by postero.us shutting down, I want to keep control on my content</li>
<li><a href="https://posthaven.com/">Posthaven</a> Having loved postero.us, this one seems cool, It&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;m not sure the guys are keeping the motivation to increase their feature list with their current business model</li>
<li><a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> Looked great, but too expensive for me (19$ per month)</li>
<li><a href="http://codrspace.com">Codrspace</a> This is a special blogging platform for coders, but it seems it has not been updated for a long time</li>
<li><a href="https://logdown.com/">LogDown</a> This also is a special blogging platform for hackers. It seemed great and had everything I was looking for &hellip; I was ready to spend the 50$ per year for it as it could save me a lot of hassle. Unfortunately, I could not find a way to forward the categories of a post as <a href="https://twitter.com/pbourgau">Twitter</a> hashtags as I&rsquo;ve been doing with Octopress and <a href="https://feedburner.google.com">Feedburner</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In the end, I was rather disappointed by the alternatives, even though I was ready to pay for them.</p>

<h2>Plan C : Fix the error in Octopress 2</h2>

<p>Eventually, the fix was rather easy. People had fixed it by patching mentos.py file in the pygments.rb gem to run Python 2 instead of the stock Python. That&rsquo;s not great because it means that I&rsquo;d have to redo the patch every time I updated my gems, or rebuilt my workspace. Here is what I added to my Vagrantfile instead :</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get -y install python2.7
</span><span class='line'>sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://github.com/philou/philou.github.com/commit/ae14c511b682295ed7fdcb3b1a818926f803dd3a">Here</a> is the commit on my Github repo.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m sticking with Octopress2 for the moment. Maybe I&rsquo;ll re-try to migrate to Octopress3 later on, when an official migration tool or <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">guide</a> is available. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m still dreaming of my perfect blogging platform :</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>Static HTML generation</li>
<li>Self or SAAS hosted</li>
<li>Great integration with social media and the web</li>
<li>Easy to maintain</li>
<li>Plugable themes</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m looking for my next side project at the moment, that could be a useful one ! Anyone interested ?</p>

    <category term="agile" /><category term="software" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a developer and you are not shipping, you&rsquo;re in the danger zone. I believe it&rsquo;s mostly your fault, and it&rsquo;s time to act.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-11-real-developers-ship/deliver.jpg" title="A delivery key on a keyboard" ></p>

<h2>Nothing new</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s been told before. Famous blogs have said the same thing :</p>

<ul>
<li>In Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=290121">Real Programmers ship</a> without any explanation, as if it meant it all.</li>
<li>In Coding Horror <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway/">Version 1 Sucks, But Ship It Anyway</a> Jeff Atwood stresses the benefits of shipping early.</li>
<li>In Coding Horror again <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/shipping-isnt-enough/">Shipping Is Not Enough</a> Jeff Atwood goes one step further and explains that we need to create software that is going to be used.</li>
<li>In his <a href="http://removingalldoubt.com/post/2006/09/19/Fatherly-Advice-To-New-Programmers.aspx">fatherly advice to new programmers</a> Chuck Jazdzewski&rsquo;s says &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get paid to program, you get paid to ship.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<h2>What does it really mean ?</h2>

<p>If you are not shipping, are you really developing something ? Maybe it&rsquo;s more some kind of research project, or maybe you are just there for learning ? <em>Real Developers know what they are in for.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because the quality is too bad, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve been developing poor quality software &hellip; <em>Real developers write quality software.</em> (BTW, shipping bug fixes is not shipping)</p>

<p>If you are not shipping because you don&rsquo;t have yet enough features, that&rsquo;s because your MVP is not small enough (despite the current Skateboard metaphor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgETWBKCRSQ">this</a> is not an MVP). <em>So Real developers follow lean (startup) principles.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because it&rsquo;s much work, that&rsquo;s because you did not automate delivery. <em>Real developers use continuous delivery.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because someone else said so, maybe it&rsquo;s time to convince her. <em>Real developers know how to deal with people.</em></p>

<p>If you are not shipping because you are in a shitty environment &hellip; <em>Real developers work on their skills to be able to quit when needed.</em></p>

<h2>Shipping above all else</h2>

<p>My point is that every developer or organization containing developers should put shipping value as their absolute priority, and things should get a lot simpler.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/"/>
    <updated>2016-05-06T04:04:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone</id>
    <category term="agile" /><category term="coaching" /><category term="pair programming" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re doing pair programming almost all the the time in our team. A few weeks ago, we went to <a href="http://www.devoxx.fr/">Devoxx</a> Paris, and 2 team mates used pair programming at a hands on session : they finished way before the others and had the time to take a 30 minute break. Pair programming delivers more &hellip; when it works.</p>

<h2>Flavors of Pair Programming</h2>

<p>Throughout our experience, we have identified some situations where it does or does not work :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Pain Zone         </th>
<th> Skill Zone</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Wandering buddies </td>
<td> Mates</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expert / Novice   </td>
<td> Mentor &amp; Apprentice</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br>


<h2>The Pain Zone</h2>

<p>Pair programming can be painful. It can feel like a waste of time or extremely frustrating. Here are the typical situations and how to fix them.</p>

<h3>The Wandering Buddies</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/going_nowhere.jpg" title="A 'going nowhere' sign" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d get if you asked to newcomers straight out of school to pair program on existing source code on day 1. They&rsquo;d be dabbling here and there, without going anywhere. Each one would try to get the keyboard to try his way, but in the end, no general direction would be followed.</p>

<p>The cure in this case (as often) is to stop and think. At least one in the pair needs to lean how to pair program. It&rsquo;s not difficult, that&rsquo;s just :</p>

<ul>
<li>Discuss and agree on a general plan first</li>
<li>Keep a todo list</li>
<li>Track your advancement on your todo list while you don&rsquo;t have the keyboard</li>
<li>Stop and discuss from time to time</li>
</ul>


<p>By starting that, the pair will quickly move into the &lsquo;mates&rsquo; state.</p>

<h3>The Export / The Novice</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/race.jpg" title="A race where Usain Bolt leave everyone meters behind" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when a &lsquo;lone wolf kind of&rsquo; expert pairs with a junior. The expert picks the keyboard, dashes through the tasks, doesn&rsquo;t make sure his pair follows (which usually means it does not).</p>

<p>Regular pair programming means a change in job responsibilities for such expert programmers. If they were expert doers before, they should now become expert mentors or coaches. That&rsquo;s quite a difference. To them, it means that their goal must be to make his pair finish the task &hellip; It can be very frustrating at first. Nevertheless, the overall skill level in teams doing that increases so fast that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very fulfilling for the team as a whole.</p>

<h2>The Skill Zone</h2>

<p>The is where we want to be. When it happens, pair programming feels productive, interesting and fulfilling. Contrary to what is often thought, this can happen whatever the skill levels of the 2 programmers.</p>

<h3>The Mates</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/to-do-list.jpg" title="A Todo list" ></p>

<p>The programmers have equivalent skills on the subject at hand. They organized in a way that they are both learning from each other. By having to verbalize what and why they are doing things, by challenging each others assumptions and by sometimes doing differently than what they&rsquo;d alone.</p>

<h3>The Mentor &amp; The Apprentice</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-05-06-pair-programming-from-pain-zone-to-skill-zone/help.jpg" title="People helping each other to climb a mountain" ></p>

<p>Other times, there can be a real difference in skills for what the pair is attempting to do. In this situation, the goal of the most knowledgeable is to train his pair, who&rsquo;s goal is to learn. The task becomes some kind of exercise on which to practice.</p>

<p>During a typical pairing session, a pair might switch many times between mentor and mates states. Each one in the pair might assume the mentor&rsquo;s role for different aspect of the work. At the end of the day, everyone should feel as if they had learned and accomplished good work.</p>

<h2>Last Word of Caution</h2>

<p>Pair programming is exhausting. Don&rsquo;t expect to be able to do 40 hours of pair programming per week. After 6 hours in a day, one usually starts to get a lot less efficient.</p>

<p>Both juniors and experienced programmers also need some time by their own, to experiment things by themselves or to complete a simple task without having worry about explaining everything.</p>

<p>These are the reasons why <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</a> stresses having a sustainable pace and leaving space for <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html">Slack time</a></p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-books-about-data-driven-lean-software-development/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-29T05:25:00+00:00</updated>

    <category term="agile" /><category term="economics" /><category term="kanban" /><category term="lean" /><category term="lpd2" /><category term="software" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In french, we say &ldquo;Le cordonnier est toujours le plus mal chaussé&rdquo; which I found an English equivalent in &ldquo;the shoemaker’s son always goes barefoot&rdquo;. I believe this is nowhere more true than in the software industry !</p>

<p>&ldquo;Software is eating the world&rdquo; they say. Software is now able to do things that only humans used to be. So why the hell are we driving our projects as if we were a horde of amateur hitch hikers ?</p>

<h2>What does it mean to be data driven ?</h2>

<p>Being data driven would allow us to answer questions such as :</p>

<ul>
<li>How much is the feature we delivered last week contributing to the bottom line ?</li>
<li>How much is the feature we are currently developing expected to contribute to the bottom line ?</li>
<li>What are the estimated cost <em>and value</em> of increasing our test coverage of 1% ?</li>
<li>What are the estimated interests and nominal amounts of our current technical debt ?</li>
<li>Which is the most valuable : improving our build system or building this new feature ?</li>
</ul>


<p>Most projects I&rsquo;ve worked in have absolutely no clue about the answers to these questions. The decision is left to experts, to the one with most influence, or simply to the developer, who can do how he thinks is best &hellip;</p>

<h2>The books</h2>

<p>Hopefully, some people are thinking differently, they believe it is possible to quantify all this, they even explain how !</p>

<p>Although this book is getting old, and is a bit outdated when compared to agile development practices, it provides real world examples of how scientific measurement can be applied to software product development.</p>

<h2>An opportunity</h2>

<p>Reading these books was a real eye opener for me. The software development world is plagued with cargo cult and supposed best practices. We follow advises, but most often without verifying if they actually work ! I believe that by applying the techniques in these books, we could create standard ways to measure the values of productivity, technical debt, quality, testing &hellip;</p>

<p>I see real opportunities to avoid a lot of useless argument between proponents of A and B, but also to communicate better with all stakeholders and finally, to reduce stress for all of us.</p>

    <category term="selforganizing" /><category term="workplace" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day, neither will be your Lego Office &hellip; This week is Devoxx in Paris, for the occasion, we decided to stream a <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/recipes-for-an-agile-workspace/">Lego office</a> experiment that my team did.</p>

<h2>What are Lego Offices</h2>

<p>I wrote about Lego office in a previous post, as a concept and a set of material that would allow teams to easily configure their workspaces as they wish. At that time, I thought of :</p>

<ul>
<li>laptops</li>
<li>extra monitors</li>
<li>tables and chairs on wheels</li>
<li>movable walls</li>
<li>movable white boards</li>
<li>movable wall screens</li>
<li>a good Wifi</li>
</ul>


<h2>Our experiment</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/empty-meeting-area.jpg" title="Meeting area in the empty office" >
<img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/empty-work-area.jpg" title="Work area in the empty office" ></p>

<p>The last floor of our building in Paris has a nice (really) open space area with rolling tables that we could use. We moved all the team there for one week. As we don&rsquo;t have laptops with Wifi, we simply asked for enough power and network plugs.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/setup-work-area.jpg" title="Setup work area" >
<img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/setup-meeting-area.jpg" title="Setup meeting area" >
<img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/setup-rest-area.jpg" title="Setup rest area" ></p>

<p>The place is large enough to have dedicated rest and meeting space. We managed to create a visio setup using our build monitor. We even had a remote lunch once, which we should repeat more often !</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s missing</h2>

<p>Obviously, this was a quick experiment, nothing like a fully architectured Lego workspace, still it helped us to discover issues and blocking points. It turns out that cables <em>are</em> an issue !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-04-20-a-lego-office-experiment/cables.jpg" title="Cables on the floor" ></p>

<p>After getting some feedback throughout the company, it turns out that some developers would never trade their high end connected desktop workstation for a Wifi laptop. Our C++ build can be pretty CPU and network intensive &hellip; I guess that means that a real Lego office might require one of the following :</p>

<ul>
<li>A technical floor with all the place required to bring any kind of cables to your machine</li>
<li>Powerful servers in a data center to do the grunt work for you</li>
<li>Single cable machines (Apple&rsquo;s USB-C is the only one I can think of right now)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Last minute question</h2>

<p>Thinking of it &hellip; could different remote offices such as your home, or a co-working space be considered as Lego blocks ?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Maybe your company too has a development program you can use to track and organize your training path. That&rsquo;s already great ! It is often not perfect though. Sometimes, the initiative in itself can feel like an afterthought. Some other times, the process is completely left to the employee and his manager, with varying results, from great to forced upon everyone.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-04-18-how-we-decentralized-our-companys-training-program/learning.jpg" title="A 'learning' word cloud" ></p>

<h2>How did we rebuild this program in our team</h2>

<p>As you might remember if you read my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/blog/categories/selforganizing/">previous posts</a>, we started a self organization initiative using a <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board</a>. When we tried to decentralize <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/">the end of year evaluation</a>, we started discussing the subjects of personal development. We decided to have a dedicated workshop about this subject</p>

<h2>Guiding principles</h2>

<p>In our company, the development program allows a manager to assign specific learning goals to his collaborators, and anyone can also create his own goals to justify going to specific trainings. Starting from that, we agreed that the development program should be used to help anyone in the team to improve skills that are interesting for both the company and the employee. If the employee is interested in something completely unrelated to work, then he should obviously tackle that in his own time. If the company needs its employee to acquire some immediate mandatory skills, then that should be part of the daily job and subject to the end of year evaluation.</p>

<p>The idea is to try to find a win-win combinations, were employees are motivated to work their best at a company that they know helps them to full-fill their long term goals.</p>

<h2>What did we came us with ?</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-04-18-how-we-decentralized-our-companys-training-program/mentor-mentee.jpg" title="A lion and a lion cub side by side" ></p>

<p>This workshop was quite effective :</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, everyone is responsible for his own development, it&rsquo;s a chance offered by the company. It cannot be forced unto people.</li>
<li>It is based on volunteer mentorship : everyone should have regular meetings with his mentor to asses his progress on his long term goal, to try to get feedback and ideas about how to move forward. We started by saying that the team leader is the default mentor, but anyone can find another mentor at any moment.</li>
<li>The process starts with the search for a long term goal. Examples are &ldquo;I want to be an agile coach&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I want to be a performance expert&rdquo;</li>
<li>With the help of the mentor if needed, the long term goal should be split in yearly objectives and tracked using <a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/HenrikJanVanderPol/how-to-outperform-anyone-else-introduction-to-okr">OKRs</a></li>
<li>Everyone is free to track his progress has he wishes. Visual tracking makes the discussion with the mentor a lot easier. We have been looking at tools to track OKRs but it was surprisingly difficult to find one that suited our use. Most are enterprisy tools with manager-managee relationships. We just wanted simple personal tracking tools. For my part, I adapted a <a href="https://trello.com/b/MPM4rspd/okrs">Trello</a> board I found on the internet.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After doing a few months of this, I can say that this has a positive aspect on motivation, people told me that they felt more in control of their destiny. Something else I noted, is that junior developers need help and guidance. They often don&rsquo;t really know what they want to do in a few years, so they really need a mentor to help them find out the what and the how. The other side of this is that a team obviously needs senior developers to act as mentor &hellip; among other things.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For an organization, there&rsquo;s something schizophrenic about valuing team work, wanting agility but sticking to individual objectives and assessments.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-03-30-how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/schizophrenic-smiley.jpg" title="A schizophrenic :(: smiley" ></p>

<p>As highlighted in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Built-Last-Successful-Visionary-Essentials/dp/0060516402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459922545&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=build+to+last">Build To Last</a> genuine company values must permeate all aspects of the organization. Being agile also means putting teamwork first and that is quite incompatible with typical individual management by objectives and bonuses.</p>

<p>This is nothing new, many have already written about the subject</p>

<ul>
<li>Joel Spolsky : <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000070.html">Incentive Pay Considered Harmful</a></li>
<li>Daniel Pink : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459665370&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=drive+daniel+pink">Drive : The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</a></li>
<li>Alfie Kohn : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punished-Rewards-Trouble-Incentive-Praise/dp/0618001816/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459665424&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=punished+by+rewards">Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A&rsquo;s, Praise, and Other Bribes</a></li>
<li>Jurgen Appelo : <a href="http://noop.nl/2013/01/the-bonus-system.html">The Bonus System</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The problem is you usually don&rsquo;t have the choice ! Whether your team wants to or not, the chances are that your company already has a mandatory individual bonus scheme in place.</p>

<h2>Our delegation initiative</h2>

<p>As you might remember if you read my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/">previous articles</a>, our team decided to move to more self organization. After identifying the end of year evaluation as something that could be further delegated, we embarked on brainstorming sessions about how to do it.</p>

<p>We discussed quite some options during our workshops. Things like :</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the goal of the annual evaluation ?</li>
<li>Should some people have a central role in the process ?</li>
<li>Should we encourage efforts or results ?</li>
<li>Should evaluations be public or private ?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s at stack at the annual evaluation ?</li>
<li>Should individual learning plans be part of the evaluation ?</li>
</ul>


<h2>What we came up with</h2>

<p>As a guiding principle, we agreed to value efforts rather than results. Sometimes, results are independent of efforts, and through efforts, it is always possible to get the best of any situation, even if the best is not a good result in itself.</p>

<h3>Throughout the year</h3>

<p>We are all sharing the same team objectives :</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;the team finishes the prioritized epics&rdquo; : we do regular epics prioritization sessions with our product owner and add the main epics to everyone&rsquo;s objectives</li>
<li>&ldquo;work on the same subject as the whole team&rdquo; : we have an overspecialization matrix that uses correlation to make sure that everyone touches the same parts of the system as the rest of the team</li>
</ul>


<p>Every 2 months, we are doing <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/feedback-on-360-degrees-feedback-session/">360° feedback sessions</a>, for everyone to give continuous feedback to others.</p>

<p>Optionally, we setup <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/intrinsic-motivation/kudo-box/">Kudo boxes</a> to give and receive thanks from others.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-03-30-how-to-deal-with-the-incentive-system-in-an-agile-team/kudo.jpg" title="A kudo card" ></p>

<h3>At the end of the year</h3>

<p>When the time of the official end of year evaluation comes, we do 360°, 1 to 1 rating on the following topics.</p>

<ul>
<li> commitment &amp; courage (doing not so fun work, find difficult compromises, say the truth, strive for quality work)</li>
<li> helping others (giving a training, providing coaching, help others, do some evangelization)</li>
<li> self improvement (taking feedback into account, improve technical skills, work on soft skills)</li>
<li> team player (build friendly environment, contribute to team improvement, positive attitude, use a non violent communication)</li>
</ul>


<p>Grades are signed, and anyone can ask someone else for a discussion about his grades.</p>

<p>Overall, everyone gets an average grade, which we use to suggest a company grade (below, achieved, exceeded) to the HR system. It then gets homogenized with the rest of the company, but this is then out of our control.</p>

<p>One thing that made this possible is also that after taking a close look at the company grade system, we saw that not so much was at stake &hellip; Provided we make sure everyone has what it takes to do the job, anyone can get an achieved evaluation by doing enough efforts. Getting an exceeded is like a bonus for a particular good year.</p>

<h2>Last word</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure we could make this more simple in an environment with more end to end feedback (start-up or pizza teams) but we feel that our current alternative is a lot better than having the manager deciding everything on his own.</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/make-hiring-everyones-business/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-21T21:05:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/make-hiring-everyones-business</id>
    <category term="hiring" /><category term="management30" /><category term="selforganizing" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let me tell you a typical hiring story. A bit more than 10 years ago, I was contractor at a bank on a C++ front office application. The system had initially been well engineer, but it had been <del>stuffed together</del> merged with another system that had a completely different architecture. Ha, and there were no automated tests. As you&rsquo;d guess, we had quite our dose of bugs, and maintaining this application was not easy.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-03-21-make-hiring-everyones-business/now-hiring.jpg" title="A 'Now Hiring' sign" ></p>

<p>The manager wanted to hire a C++ programmer to beef up the team. Along with the division&rsquo;s architect he was conducting interviews to find just that guy. A few weeks later, he found a known C++ &amp; Windows local expert. A few weeks later, the team unanimously declared that we could not work with him because he was both pretentious and incompetent.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure every developer already witnessed a similar story.</p>

<h2>Managers do the hiring</h2>

<p>This is the usual practice. The motivation is that managers have more experience so they should be better at it, and also that it alleviates developers from non-programming work. As we saw in the introduction story, there are issues with this approach too :</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s pretty bad for the team &lsquo;fit&rsquo; : there is no team building here. You often end up with a collection of individual working at the same place rather than with a real team.</li>
<li>during these interviews, the candidate only interacts with a particular type of profiles, who can tell how he&rsquo;ll be doing with more junior team members for example ?</li>
<li>as usual, this administrative work removes some programming from the manager&rsquo;s time. That&rsquo;s often not a good bargain</li>
<li>it decreases the team sense of control, as it is being &lsquo;forced&rsquo; to work with someone they did not choose. This makes it harder for them to take responsibility of what they are trying to achieve.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How we self organized hiring</h2>

<p>As I already explained in a <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/">previous post</a> we engaged in various self delegation initiative by doing a <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board</a>. During this meeting, we identified hiring as something that could be self delegated.</p>

<p>In order to fix that, we started a workshop for 1 hour per day with a sub group of the team. We started with a brainstorming, then we voted, and finally presented our proposition to the rest of the team, which actually validated it. The whole thing lasted for one week (5 hours).</p>

<p><a href="http://dilbert.com"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-03-21-make-hiring-everyones-business/dilbert.jpg" title="A Dilbert cartoon about hiring based on internet profile" ></a></p>

<h2>What we decided for hiring</h2>

<p>Here is the process we have decided to follow to handle hiring team members</p>

<ol>
<li>First, everyone in the team is responsible to speak up when he thinks we need to hire someone, during our retrospectives for example</li>
<li>To handle new applications, we have prepared an online interview. It contains open questions and online coding exercises, on <a href="http://www.cyber-dojo.org/">cyber-dojo</a>, which allows us to track all the candidates iterations</li>
<li>We do a round robin to find out who will follow the candidate through the hiring process. This means taking notes, organizing interviews, keeping the rest of the team up to date.</li>
<li>When a candidate passes the online interview, we will receive him for an technical and general interview with 2 people from the team.</li>
<li>All the team will then meet the candidate for a coffee break, in order to know if he will fit in the team</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll then play the <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/6053596147744768/">Google hiring committee</a> until we reach a consensus</li>
<li>When in doubt, we&rsquo;ll do extra interviews, and repeat</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s just what we came up with, if you start this road, you might well come up with a very different process.</p>

<h2>One more thing</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to have a selective hiring, but you&rsquo;ll also need to improve the input of the hiring pipeline, but that&rsquo;s <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/great-developers-are-free/">another story</a> &hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We don&rsquo;t have an official scrum master in our team anymore. We now have 7 ! A different team member assumes the full scrum master role at every sprint.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-03-15-scrum-teams-do-not-need-a-scrum-master/round-robin.jpg" title="A fat round robin bird" ></p>

<h2>Why did we switch to Scrum Master round robin ?</h2>

<p>It all started with our <a href="https://management30.com/product/delegation-poker/">delegation poker</a> (see <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/">previous post</a>). We noticed that there were still quite some activities that I (the manager) was the only one to do. We hoped that by sharing these activities throughout the team, we would :</p>

<ul>
<li>increase everyone&rsquo;s motivation by showing a bigger picture</li>
<li>leave me more time for programming</li>
<li>learn new skills to everyone</li>
</ul>


<h2>How did we do it ?</h2>

<p>Before our <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board meeting</a>, we had prepared all the activities we are regularly doing. We found quite a few recurrent non programming tasks that traditionally eschewed to the team lead (me in that case). The initial plan was to find ways to delegate these activities to the team during the meeting, but it would have took way too much time.</p>

<p>Having identified all these activities, I individually suggested at everyone in the team to do a round robin scrum master role, which would handle all these activities for a sprint. I was happily surprise by the quasi complete buy-in from all the team. Before I announced it to the team, I did 2 things :</p>

<h3>List all the activities of the scrum master.</h3>

<p>Here is a subset :</p>

<ul>
<li>attend other teams meetings</li>
<li>make sure there are enough workable stories for the next planning session with the product owner</li>
<li>prepare and animate a retrospective</li>
<li>animate the demo</li>
</ul>


<h3>Make this more fun !</h3>

<script async src="http://philippe.bourgau.net//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I bought totems for the scrum master. The team chose to keep Yoda in Paris and send Darth Vador in <a href="https://twitter.com/ahmadatwi">Ahmad</a> suitcase back in Beirut.</p>

<h2>What did we get ?</h2>

<p>After a few sprints of this, the feedback I got is that people like the increased involvement in the big picture (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458076848&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=daniel+pink+drive">Daniel Pink told us that already</a>). On my part, it allowed to increase my programming time to nearly 7 uninterrupted days per sprint (10 days). I&rsquo;m quite happy with this ! As for the third goal, learning new skills, I guess we&rsquo;ll need a bit more time to figure this out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most companies don&rsquo;t have <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/performance-management/">unlimited vacations</a>. Most likely, if you are an employee, your days off need to be validated by your boss. If you are like me, this feels like pulling teeth &hellip; Every time I have to ask for a day off, I feel like a kid asking for an extra candy</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not the only issue with how we traditionally deal with vacations :</p>

<ul>
<li>The boss has to make sure that there are always enough people at the office to handle emergencies</li>
<li>If the boss is himself away, getting a day off at the last moment becomes difficult</li>
</ul>


<h2>Our Delegation Board</h2>

<p>Our team at work is already rather agile : we&rsquo;re using a blend of XP and Scrumban, we follow solid engineering practices and we are always trying to improve to deliver more value to our users. After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Management-3-0-Developers-Developing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321712471/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457988177&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=management+3.0">Management 3.0</a> and <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/">Management Workouts</a> I was convinced that I needed to move the team towards even more self organization.</p>

<p>We started by doing <a href="https://management30.com/product/delegation-poker/">delegation poker</a>, we created a <a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/">delegation board</a>, and set out to move all cards we could to the right side of the board.</p>

<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-03-12-stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/delegation-board-large.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-03-12-stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/delegation-board.jpg" title="Our trello delegation board" ></a></p>

<p>We spotted the following topics that could be more self organized</p>

<ul>
<li>vacations</li>
<li>hiring</li>
<li>business objectives and end of year evaluations</li>
<li>various recurring scrum related activities</li>
<li>self development objectives</li>
</ul>


<h2>Vacations</h2>

<p>We decided to tackle vacations first, because it seemed easy. We did a quick brainstorming, and here is what we came up with :</p>

<ul>
<li>We cannot change the company policy, so I&rsquo;ll still have to officially validate everyone&rsquo;s vacations in the system but &hellip;</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll validate anything asked !</li>
<li>Our internal system allows to check the other team member&rsquo;s vacations, so everyone in the team is responsible to check that there will always be at least 2 people at work before taking a day off</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-03-12-stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/mxopal.png"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-03-12-stop-feeling-like-a-kid-everytime-you-ask-a-day-off/mxopal.jpg" title="Screenshot of our vacation dashboard" ></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been 6 months, and it&rsquo;s been working like a charm. I think it made everything simpler once we had a clear rule about when vacations were OK or not.</p>
