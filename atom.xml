    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re having difficulties writing good performance related stories for your projet, that&rsquo;s no surprise ! We&rsquo;ve been through the same troubles and we found a way that works a lot better.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-01-08-how-to-write-good-performance-stories/speed.jpg" title="A Mb speed counter" ></p>

<p>TODO picture of something fast</p>

<h2>Solution 1 : <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/performance-is-a-feature/">Performance is a feature</a></h2>

<p>Right ? In typical agile way, a story about performance would be written like</p>

<blockquote><p>As marketting, I want the page load to perform under 1 second, In order for the customers to stay on the site</p></blockquote>

<p>If the performance bottleneck and the fix are obvious, that might work very well. If that&rsquo;s your case, then go on, that&rsquo;s the simplest way!</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, we are not in that case. <a href="http://www.murex.com">At work</a> we are building a risk engine and we need to perform extremely well on a wide set of different scenarios. Imagine a story such as</p>

<blockquote><p>As a risk manager, I want the VAR scenario to compute in less than 1 second, in order to have real time data</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>we&rsquo;re pretty sure that there won&rsquo;t be 1 but many bottlenecks to fix before reaching the expected performance</li>
<li>speeding up the VAR scenario might slow down other scenarios</li>
</ul>


<p>That makes this kind of story too fuzzy. We tried them, and we had difficulties to estimate and close them.</p>

<h2>Solution 2 : Back to the traditional way</h2>

<p>Without an agile backlog, developers would have worked on tasks such as</p>

<blockquote><p>Add caching to the computation engine</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s estimable, but we&rsquo;ve got no clue of the <em>why</em> ! When it&rsquo;s done, we won&rsquo;t be able to know whether it&rsquo;s worth to keep it or not. In fact, tt&rsquo;s just not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic">story</a>) !</p>

<h2>Solution 3 : Mixing both</h2>

<p>Here is how we we are now writing performance stories at work :</p>

<blockquote><p>As a risk manager, I want to have caching in the computation engine, in order to the VAR sceneario compute under 1 second (in order to have real time data)</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s now estimable, we know what it&rsquo;s there for. It&rsquo;s obviously not enough though : we know that we will very likely need to do other performance stories after this one.</p>

<h2>Embrace uncertainty</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2016-01-08-how-to-write-good-performance-stories/engine.jpg" title="A Maserati engine" ></p>

<p>The fact is that in our context, getting better performances is <em>hard</em> :</p>

<ul>
<li>it requires a lot of work</li>
<li>we don&rsquo;t know how much at the begining</li>
<li>we often try things that don&rsquo;t work</li>
</ul>


<p>This makes the whole project more uncertain, so we&rsquo;re better off embracing this uncertainty in the way we write and prioritize our performance stories.</p>

    <updated>2015-12-31T12:24:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/great-developers-are-free</id>
    <category term="enterprise" /><category term="hiring" /><category term="self-organization" /><category term="software" /><category term="team-building" /><category term="workplace" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For many reasons. But mostly because they are key to efficiently growing a software organization.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-12-31-great-developers-are-free/cat-codes-for-food.jpg" title="A funny picture sleeping on a keyboard, with the mention 'Will code for food'" ></p>

<h2>A tale of 2 teams</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at 2 software teams in the world of corporate finance.</p>

<h3>The junior in-house team</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/emploi/2013/12/07/09005-20131207ARTFIG00309-bruit-temperature-air8230-les-salaries-reserves-sur-l-open-space.php"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-12-31-great-developers-are-free/open-space.jpg" title="A big corporate open space" ></a></p>

<p>One is an in-house software development team in a large bank. The project already has a bad reputation among developers.The bank has difficulties to hire so the team is constituted of 10 rather junior developers. Unfortunately, without guidance and long term vision, the quality of the code suffers. It looks like an ad-hoc composition of various technolgies, glue code, and reinvented frameworks. The overall result is a barely good enough product that costs a small fortune in maintainance and support. The user experience is awful, which make it difficult to the the team leaders and the users to collaborate effectively. As a result of all this, the project is suffering from high turnover. Managing this project is really challenging &hellip; and kind of depressing.</p>

<h3>The experienced software team</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.personalized-software.ie/aboutus"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-12-31-great-developers-are-free/experienced-team.jpg" title="An experienced software team" ></a></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s imagine the same product developed at a software house. It&rsquo;s been on the market for a while now, but new features are regularly added to it at a good pace. The product is solid and the users are happy using it. The structure of the team is completely different : 5 developers, mainly experienced, coming from various backgrounds. As a result, the team builds on all their different expertises to build real competitive advantages. They tend to get into healthy debates about a lot of things, such as :</p>

<ul>
<li>Should we re-use or re-write ?</li>
<li>Is this gold plating or plain technical debt ?</li>
<li>Which technology should we use to build this ?</li>
</ul>


<p>In the end, that makes the product even better. The humane side of the team is also completely different. These experienced developers have all been exposed to the big picture during their careers, and they know things like :</p>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Business talk&rsquo; and so they can discuss product topics with the product managers</li>
<li>The best way to go through chores at work is to do them right now</li>
<li>Enough management, testing, ops to make the team self organized</li>
</ul>


<p>The single junior developer in the team tends to mimic this model, and has ease finding mentors, to teach him their trade and to give him career counsels.</p>

<p>As a result, the product and the team remain healthy, and keep providing benefits to all stakeholders.</p>

<h2>Benefits of experienced teams</h2>

<p>First, from a purely short term financial point of view, it&rsquo;s a no brainer ! Even if you pay experienced developers twice as much as juniors, the costs will still be on par. But the difference in created value is huge !</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s then have a look at the longer term, organizational aspect of things. Obviously, managing such teams requires a lot less work ! Both because of their size and because experienced developers tends to manage themselves very well &hellip; Promoting self-organized &amp; cross-functionnal teams is a great opportunity to reduce the management cost and friction, making the organization more reactive and cost efficient in the long run.</p>

<h2>What is an experienced developer ?</h2>

<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;ve worked with people that were experienced on paper, but not in practice. I <a href="http://www.jrothman.com/htp/interview/2004/12/whats-a-year-of-experience/">read</a> that repeating 10 times the same year of work only amounts to 1 year of experience.</p>

<p>If I was asked to give a definition, I&rsquo;d say that experienced developers have worked on different kind of systems (embeded, web, client, server &hellip;) using different technologies (Java, Ruby, C, Spring, Rails, Javascript &hellip;). Their experiences need not be professional, I&rsquo;ve seen a physics teacher that hacked himself into a great hacker through side projects and open source. Speaking of the subject, good developers always spent a lot of time learning, reading, doing side projects and contributing to open source. Some can be found in local user groups and online programming communities.</p>

<h2>So How do you get them ?</h2>

<p>I can only think of 3 obvious ways :</p>

<ul>
<li>train them</li>
<li>keep them</li>
<li>hire them</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure training them will not be an issue if you already have enough of them. So that brings us to the 2 other points.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/guided-visit-prestashops-new-paris-headquarters/"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-12-31-great-developers-are-free/prestashop.jpg" title="The prestashop offices in Paris" ></a></p>

<p>Lot&rsquo;s of articles have been written about attracting and keeping the best developers. Some companies even made it <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html">their differentiating point</a>. Here are a few links :</p>

<ul>
<li>In his post <a href="http://avc.com/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky/">&ldquo;The Management Team&rdquo;</a> Joel Splosky details the inverted pyramid model</li>
<li>Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s (again) <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/DevelopmentAbstraction.html">Development Abstraction Layer</a> explains all the physical environment that makes programmers happy at work</li>
<li><a href="http://qz.com/169147/applications-have-doubled-to-the-company-that-discloses-its-salaries/">After disclosing employee salaries, Buffer was inundated with resumes</a> when <a href="http::/www.buffer.com">buffer.com</a> publicly disclosed <a href="https://open.buffer.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/">their salary formula</a>, the number of applications the company received doubled</li>
<li>Spotify organizes <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2013/02/15/organizing-a-hack-week/">Hack Weeks</a> where  the company stops for a while to invent new things</li>
<li>Google summarizes it &ldquo;Do Cool Things That Matters&rdquo; in their long advertises <a href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/">Life At Google</a></li>
</ul>


<p>These are just a few examples and are by no way the only things that motivate developers. To summarize, provide the best working conditions (careful, that not money), and communicate a lot about it.</p>

<h2>Hiring is too important to be left to HR</h2>

<p><a href="https://management30.com/product/workouts/">Jurgen Appelo</a> said</p>

<blockquote><p>Management is too important to be left to managers.</p></blockquote>

<p>I guess the same thing can be said about hiring.</p>

<p>Engineers are absolutely required to take the main role when hiring other engineers. Companies that seriously want to have the best developers on board are spending substantial engineering time on hiring. Here are some well known examples :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/hiringprocess/">Google</a> is known to conduct around 9 interviews before hiring someone</li>
<li>In its <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf">Handbook for New Employee</a> Valve explicitly states that hiring is your most important role</li>
</ul>


<h2>Endword</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Tom_DeMarco">Tom DeMarco</a> said about quality, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451733851&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=peopleware">Peopleware</a> :</p>

<blockquote><p>Great developers are free, but only for those who are willing to pay for them</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Current software project tracking tools suck !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-12-14-my-dream-lean-software-development-tool-lean-software-development-part-9/it-sucks.jpg" title="A stamp that writes &#34;SUCKS&#34;" alt="A stamp that writes &#34;SUCKS&#34;"></p>

<p>By writing <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/the-flow-book-summary-lean-software-development_part_1/">this series of posts</a>, I realized that they should help us to prioritize rather than just serving as a nice GUIs on top of a ticket database.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take the story of developer Joe as an example. Joe is working for Megacorp, where he makes a good living, but feels like a small cog in the machine. He has lost the thrill of programming &hellip; He&rsquo;s still staying informed about latest trends in software world, but his job involves aging technologies. He knows that if he wants to remain in the course, he has to change gears. One day, he decides to do something <em>now</em>, and starts a side project in the hope of someday making a living out of it.</p>

<p>He does not have a large amount of money to invest in his project, so he decides to bootstrap his product using <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a>. He reads and understands that there is a lot of different kind of activities to do if he wants to realize his dream : experiments, marketing, sales, design, coding &hellip;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he&rsquo;s so tired of programming boring stuff that he contracted the developer bias : he starves to code cool things again ! He knows the rest is important, he tries to do some of it, but he just doesn&rsquo;t realize how <em>much</em> needs to be done. So, without realising it, he wastes a lot of time coding something that people eventually don&rsquo;t buy. After 1 or 2 years of hard work, a working product but no users, he eventually quits, quite depressed &hellip;</p>

<p>I guess you don&rsquo;t want to be Joe ! I know you&rsquo;ll think it won&rsquo;t happen to you &hellip; believe me, it can, <a href="rip-mes-courses-dot-fr/">I learned it the hard way</a> !</p>

<p>Now suppose you had a tool that estimates the expected values of all different tasks :</p>

<ul>
<li>By applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo simulations</a> to probabilistic value and size ranges, it could compute which features we should work on first. As a side effect, this could give us some release date estimates for a feature, depending on its position in the backlog.</li>
<li>By having explicit experiment tasks with target value or size ranges, it could compute the value of information and prioritize experiments versus other tasks.</li>
<li>Crossing informations from IDEs, VCS, Quality Trackers and CIs, it could detect technical debt items (aka. productivity opportunities), compute their values in the long run, and prioritize them with other tasks.</li>
<li>If we found a way to integrate marketing, sales and design tasks, any kind of activity could be stored in the backlog, valued and prioritized.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is what the backlog could look like :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-12-14-my-dream-lean-software-development-tool-lean-software-development-part-9/mockup.jpg" title="A mockup of the backlog view of such a product" ></p>

<p>All different kind of activities (developments, marketing, experiments, refactorings) would fit in the backlog. The system would estimate the value of every task for Joe, advising him what to work on first. It would make it obvious just how much market experiments are important when starting ! With such a tool, he is a lot more likely to build his new life.</p>

<p>The good thing with such a tool is that it could be built by feeding itself. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">Eating its own dog&rsquo;s food</a> has always been the nice thing about writing software tools.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to know, what do you think of the idea ? Would you use such a tool ? Is it worth me spending my nights building it ?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There must be a way to know the real money value of <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-12-07-how-ill-measure-the-lean-startup-value-of-information-in-my-next-side-project-lean-software-development-part-8/knowledge-money.jpg" title="A brain or some money ?" ></p>

<p>Lean Startup is about gathering &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; through experiments instead of building things. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450068976&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=lean+product+development">Flow book</a> suggests that the value of an information is its expected impact on the bottom line. So by combining both, there should be a way to compute a quantitative value for the knowledge.</p>

<p>The overall plan would be :</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a rough business plan, but assume that all that&rsquo;s in it has got 1 chance out of 10 of being right</li>
<li>Design experiments to precise the likelyhood of what&rsquo;s in the business plan</li>
<li>Compute the value of each experiment as the difference of the expected bottom line after and before running it (This should be possible if relying on the business plan for other parameters)</li>
<li>Work on the task with the highest expected value, be it an experiment, a development, a sales task, or whatever</li>
<li>Adapt you business plan with any new information</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
<li>If it becomes obvious that the expected final earnings are too low, pivot</li>
</ol>


<p>Flow explains that all the principles are pretty robust to bad inputs and errors. In short, the final estimations of earnings are still a lot better than without using any specific method. In the case of Lean Startup, it means that a false business plan is a good enough starting point.</p>

<h2>How to assess the likelyhood of a figure ?</h2>

<p>By default let&rsquo;s assume the value of a feature is somewhere between 0 and your highest estimate. As we&rsquo;ll go through experiments we&rsquo;ll be able to narrow this value range and have a more accurate estimate for the real value.</p>

<p>To keep things simple we could assume that the probability of value is uniformaly distributed within this range. From what I read in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449901015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=waltzing+with+bears">Waltzing With Bears</a>, here would be a more realistic probability distribution.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-12-07-how-ill-measure-the-lean-startup-value-of-information-in-my-next-side-project-lean-software-development-part-8/Demarco-probability.png" title="The curve of the probability of value according to DeMarco" ></p>

<h2>How to estimate the value of an experiment ?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into the details here, because the logic is exactly the same as with technical experiments (which <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/measure-the-business-value-of-your-spikes-and-take-high-payoff-risks-lean-software-development-part-4/">I already wrote about</a>)</p>

<p>Since then though, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449901015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=waltzing+with+bears">Waltzing With Bears</a> which presents a way of doing Monte Carlo simulations in order to estimate risks on your project. I guess the same thing could be used for value, which would save us from a lot of complex math.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449901015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=waltzing+with+bears"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-12-07-how-ill-measure-the-lean-startup-value-of-information-in-my-next-side-project-lean-software-development-part-8/waltzing-with-bears.jpg" title="Cover of 'Waltzing With Bears'" ></a></p>

<h2>When to stop doing experiments ?</h2>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t all this overkill ? One could argue that the point of Lean Startup should be to build just enough knowledge ! In fact, this value of information concept naturaly helps to find out when running the experiment is not worth it compared to actually doing the real thing.</p>

<p>BTW, a tool doing all this for your automaticaly would be great, wouldn&rsquo;t it ?</p>

<h2>What I&rsquo;ll do for my next bootstrap side project</h2>

<ol>
<li>Start with a target hourly earning rate.</li>
<li>Collect a list of projects I&rsquo;d be interested in.</li>
<li>Pick a project and write a business goal for it.</li>
<li>Assign likelyhoods and ranges on every figure in the business plan.</li>
<li>Design experiments to improve the figures.</li>
<li>Create tasks to actually build and sell the product.</li>
<li>Compute values for each of these tasks.</li>
<li>Work the most valueable first.</li>
<li>If the figures prove that I will not make my target wage with this project, I&rsquo;ll pivot, and restart from 2.</li>

<p>I am using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> together to handle my various development environments. It usually works just fine : it&rsquo;s fast, low weight, it keeps my machine clean and it&rsquo;s quite simple once you&rsquo;ve setup your first VM. Until last time &hellip; read on !</p>

<p>When I tried to start my docker session through Vagrant as usuall, here is the error I suddenly got :</p>

<p>After a bit of Google searching, I found that the docker service needed to be started. <code>service docker start</code> did the trick &hellip; until next reboot !</p>

<p>With still some more Googling, I found a <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/19320/how-to-enable-or-disable-services">page</a> explaining how to manage Ubuntu services. In order to make the docker service automaticaly start at every reboot, I just had to enter the following :</p>

<p>That did the trick ! I thought that might be useful for others.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Madoff would have been better off managing software projects than investing on Wall Street !</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-10-01-the-technical-debt-ponzi-scheme/bernie.jpg" title="&#34;Madoff's photo in jail&#34;" alt="&#34;Madoff's photo in jail&#34;"></p>

<p>Whereas in finance, a Ponzi scheme is a sure road to jail, it seems to be the de-facto standard in software development.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Software-Debt-Inevitable-Development/dp/0321554132/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443728175&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=managing+technical+debt">Managing Software Debt</a>, hoping to find methods about how to manage technical debt with some hard numbers (instead I found some good practices to avoid it, but that&rsquo;s another story). At no place did I read that taking more debt to pay the interests of existing debt was a good practice though &hellip;</p>

<p>Thinking of it, I can remember of such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi Schemes</a> in nearly every organization I worked in. Here are a few typical manifestations I saw :</p>

<ul>
<li>writing bogus code to compensate for some other bogus code</li>
<li>creating tools to workaround existing technical debt. Ex:

<ul>
<li>exotic build tools to build some code riddled with cyclic dependencies that no sane build tool can build</li>
<li>in house tools that do 10% of what standard (open source) tools can do on code following main standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>If this goes on for too long, you can end up in a technical debt death spiral : you know debt is out of control, so taking debt becomes the only way of actually getting anything done. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s win this client now, because we won&rsquo;t be able to later &hellip;&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s like running to one&rsquo;s own ruin.</p>

<p>If your organization is in this stage, you might think at the <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/">&lsquo;time horizon&rsquo;</a> of your product, and discover that fixing the technical debt sometimes brings more value than getting this new client !</p>

<blockquote><p>Silosis: an internal organization of an enterprise in which people are grouped by job titles.

<p>Here are other reasons I don&rsquo;t like silos :</p>

<ul>
<li>Silos create local optimums, which <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/B00CAYOX3O/ref=sr_1_sc_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441546057&amp;sr=8-2-spell&amp;keywords=reinsertsen+flow">lean theory</a> (and mathematics) taught us is bad</li>
<li>Silos create specialists, which bring the whole system to a halt when they leave</li>
<li>Silos create work queue, which increase cycle time</li>
<li>Silos create some form of black market in the organization, through which people can bypass the official communication channel and actually get the job done</li>
<li>Silos hides the big picture to anyone, thus removing autonomy from and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441546115&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=daniel+pink+drive">demotivating people</a></li>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The sad truth :</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> metaphor does not help me to fix it.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-08-20-a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/debt.jpg" title="&#34;A desperate man counting his debts&#34;" alt="&#34;A desperate man counting his debts&#34;"></p>

<p>Here is my modest 2€ plan about how to try to get out of this.</p>

<h2>Why does the metaphor fall short ?</h2>

<p>The debt comparison effectively helps non programming people to understand that bad code costs money. Unfortunately, it does not tell you how much. As a consequence, deciding whether it&rsquo;s best to fix the technical debt or to live with it remains a gut feeling decision <del>(aka programmers want to stop the world and fix all of it while the product owner wants to live with it)</del>.</p>

<p>They are very good reason why we cannot measure how much the technical debt costs :</p>

<ul>
<li>It is purely subjective : bad code for someone might be good code for another. Even worse, as you become a better programmer, yesterday&rsquo;s master piece might become today&rsquo;s crap. More often, as a team gains insight on the domain, old code might suddenly appear completely wrong &hellip;</li>
<li>Tools such as Sonar only spot the a small part of the debt. The larger part (design, architecture and domain) remains invisible</li>
<li>Finally, non-remediation cost (the time wasted working on the bad code) is often overlooked and very difficult to measure : it depends on what you are going to work in the future !</li>
</ul>


<p>No surprise it&rsquo;s difficult to convince anyone else why fixing your debt is a good investment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dilbert.com"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-08-20-a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/dilbert.jpg" title="&#34;A dilbert cartoon about a programmer killed by technical debt&#34;" alt="&#34;A dilbert cartoon about a programmer killed by technical debt&#34;"></a></p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>In the team, we usually try not to create debt in the first place. We have strong code conventions and working agreements. We are doing a lot of refactoring in order to keep our code base clean. But even with all this, debt creeps in :</p>

<ul>
<li>a pair worked on something and did not know that there is another part of the system that does roughly the same thing</li>
<li>we understand something new about the domain and some previously fine code becomes debt !</li>
<li>like all programmers, we are constantly in a hurry, and sometimes, we just let debt through</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>If the required refactoring is small enough, we just slip it inside a user story and do it on the fly. The real problem comes larger refactorings.</p>

<p>The strategy to deal with those is to get estimations of both the remediation and non-remediation costs. This way, the technical debt becomes an investment ! Invest X$ now and receive Y$ every month up to the end of the life of product. Provided you have the Cost Of Delay of the product, you can estimate the cost of delay of this individual technical debt fix. For example :</p>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s define the product horizon as its expected remaining life span at any moment</li>
<li>Suppose the product has a 5 years (60 months) horizon</li>
<li>Suppose the Cost Of Delay of the full product is 150K€/month</li>
<li>Suppose that the technical debt costs 10 days (0.5 month) to fix</li>
<li>Suppose that that once fixed, you&rsquo;ll save 2 days (0.1 month) of work per month</li>
<li>By doing the fix now, at the end of the 5 years, you would have saved : <em>(60 &ndash; 0.5) * 0.1 &ndash; 0.5 = 5.45 months</em></li>
<li>Using CoD, this ammounts to : <em>5.45 * 159K = 817.5K €</em></li>
<li>Dividing by the number of months, we finaly get the CoD for this technical debt fix : <em>817.5K / 60 = 13 625 €/month</em></li>
</ul>


<p>This can be compared to the CoD of other backlog items, allowing us to prioritize large refactorings as we would of any feature or story.</p>

<p>One nice thing about this is that it not only helps to know if a refactoring is cost effective, but also when is the best moment to do it. As the CoD of the refactoring is proportional to inverse of the product horizon, a premature refactoring for a startup product might become a real bargain after the product has settled as a market leader. Here are examples of possible product horizons :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Context </th>
<th> Horizon</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Startup </td>
<td> 6 months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 years old company </td>
<td> 3 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Market leading product </td>
<td> 10 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aging System </td>
<td> 5 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Legacy System </td>
<td> 2 years</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br/>


<p>Oh, and just one more thing &hellip; prioritizing technical debt fixes in your backlog will create some real time to focus on and only on refactoring, reducing task switching and saving even more time.</p>

<p>All this sounds great ! There&rsquo;s just one last little thing : how do we get estimations of both costs of the technical debt ?</p>

<h2>Idea 1 : Collective Estimations</h2>

<p>When I attended Donald Reinertsen&rsquo;s training, I asked him the question and he answered :</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;d gather the top programmers in a room and I&rsquo;d make them do an estimation of both costs.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I asked my team if they wanted to do the following :</p>

<ol>
<li>whenever you spot a large piece of debt, create a JIRA issue for it</li>
<li>at the end of your next sprint planning session, go through all your technical debt issues, and for each

<ol>
<li>estimate the remediation cost in story points</li>
<li>estimate the non-remediation cost on the coming sprint, taking the prioritized stories into account</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>using the ROI horizon for every issues, collectively decide which one to tackle and add them to the sprint backlog</li>
</ol>


<p>To keep the story short, it did not stick. I bet it was just too boring.</p>

<h2>Idea 2 : Technical Debt Code Annotations</h2>

<p>During a retrospective, we discussed marking technical debt directly in the code to decide when to fix it. I created 2 code annotations so that this can be done. Here is an example of some identified technical debt :</p>

<p>The @TechnicalDebt annotation identifies areas of the code that could be improved.
The @Waste annotation is a way to log time wasted because of this bad code.</p>

<p>By comparing the time to fix the technical debt and the flow of extra work it incurs, we should be able to more easily justify and prioritize these in our backlog.</p>

<p>We are thinking of writing a sonar plugin to keep track of this technical debt right in our <a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">Sonar dashboard</a>. It would :</p>

<ul>
<li>create a technical debt item in sonar for every @TechnicalDebt annotation found in the code</li>
<li>link it with a mirror technical debt issue in JIRA</li>
<li>use the story points we entered in the annotation as remediation cost</li>
<li>extrapolate the non remediation cost by the sum of wasted hours registered during the last month</li>
</ul>


<p>We just started using those, and I cannot give enough feedback for the moment. I bet not enough @Waste items will be entered though &hellip; again, it might just be too boring</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-08-20-a-plan-for-technical-debt-lean-software-development-part-7/sonar-sqale.jpg" title="&#34;A screenshot of Sonar Qube Sqale technical debt plugin&#34;" alt="&#34;A screenshot of Sonar Qube Sqale technical debt plugin&#34;"></a></p>

<h2>Idea 3 : Sonar and IDE Plugins</h2>

<p>If it&rsquo;s too boring to add @Waste annotations in the code, it might be easier to have an IDE plugin with 1 big button to register some time wasted on the local @TechnicalDebt zone.</p>

<p>Pushing things a bit further, it might even be possible to estimate non remediation cost by having a look at what files are read the more, what files are triggering the more test failures when changed, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s a long shot, we&rsquo;re definitely not there yet !</p>

<h2>Possible Improvements</h2>

<h3>The Mikado Method</h3>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;ve got these estimations or not, it&rsquo;s always a good practice to learn how to  use the <a href="https://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/the-mikado-method-in-under-a-minute/">mikado method</a>. It&rsquo;s great to split a refactoring into smaller part and spread them over many sprints.</p>

<p>The pill is easier to swallow for everyone, and it keeps the code releasable at any given time.</p>

<h3>Decision Rule</h3>

<p>Provided you have :</p>

<ul>
<li>Product CoD</li>
<li>Top Features CoD</li>
<li>Product horizon</li>
</ul>


<p>You could easily come up with a <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/you-dont-have-to-ask-your-boss-for-a-fast-build-lean-software-development-part-6/">decision rule</a> to help us prioritizing technical debt more quickly, without the need for a formal planning.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>In search of an experienced software engineer</h2>

<p>We have been trying to hire such a profile for the last year &hellip; The position is hopefully filled now. During that year, we have tried to mine <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> for candidates. Here is how we did it.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-08-19-mining-github-for-new-hires/github.png" title="Github's banner" ></p>

<p>Software engineers, especially experienced, are known to be hard to find. Over the past months, we had steadily been improving our hiring process :</p>

<ul>
<li>By regularly rewriting and optimizing our job post</li>
<li>By posting it on Twitter</li>
<li>By defining a precise interview template</li>
</ul>


<p>We went from very few applications to :</p>

<ul>
<li>More applications</li>
<li>More experienced candidates</li>
<li>Regular interviews</li>
<li>Effective interviews</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately, we were still not interviewing candidates as skilled as we would have liked to. We were convinced that we were offering a great job : the project is very interesting, and the team is a dream to work in.</p>

<h2>How could we reach more great devs ?</h2>

<p>Someday, I played with <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>&rsquo;s Rest Api and I managed to write a short ruby script that finds the contributors to a given project that are living near Paris (France).</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next ?</h2>

<p>We eventually filled the position before following our github experiment. We might continue some day though ! Here is a list of improvements I thought of :</p>

<ul>
<li>Gather a list of projects that overlap with what we are building</li>
<li>Search for repositories using some keyword or regular expression</li>
<li>List github users that contributed to such projects, that live near us and that know java</li>
<li>Use more complex algorithms to find best candidates (<a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/2010/02/10/algorithmic-recruitment-with-github/">Algorithmic Recruitment With GitHub</a>)</li>
<li>Spend more time socializing on GitHub (<a href="http://www.sourcecon.com/news/2014/01/21/the-complete-guide-to-recruiting-and-sourcing-candidates-on-github/">The Complete Guide To Recruiting And Sourcing Candidates On GitHub</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>It really looks like if software is eating recruitment &hellip;</p>

    <link href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-17T05:46:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira</id>
    <category term="jira" /><category term="kanban" /><category term="programming" /><category term="self-organization" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, I wrote that <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/real-programmers-have-todo-lists/">Real Programmers have TODO lists</a> &hellip; I was wrong, I now work without a TODO list ! So either I&rsquo;m not a real programmer anymore, or I&rsquo;m actually using TODO List v.2.0. Read on !</p>

<h2>Motivations</h2>

<p>My work has become quite varied lately. On top of programming and pairing, I am also doing quite some coaching within the team. For the whole Murex programmers community, I&rsquo;m organizing <a href="https://github.com/murex/murex-coding-dojo">Coding Dojos</a>, <a href="http://www.brownbaglunch.fr/">Brown Bag Lunches</a> and Technical Talk Video Sessions. Finaly, like all of us, I have to cope with my share of organization overhead.</p>

<p>Multitasking was starting to kill me. I was feeling exhausted at the end of the day, with the certainty that I was not getting much done &hellip;</p>

<h2>Personnal Kanban To The Rescue</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a> is a method to organize your work relying on <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/featured/why-limit-work-in-progress/#sthash.QFI0D8l5.dpbs">Work In Progress limits</a> : it minimizes multitasking and encourages prioritization.</p>

<p>As its name suggests it, <a href="http://personalkanban.com">Personal Kanban</a> is simply applying Kanban to your own tasks. It turns out that :</p>

<ul>
<li>My team tasks are already in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a></li>
<li>Some guys have already tried to <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-13472">use JIRA as a todo list</a></li>
<li>JIRA supports Kanban boards with WIP limits and all</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Kanban Board</h2>

<p>In our team, <a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net">TAYARA Bilal</a> had already experimented the approach and asked to JIRA admins to create us a custom project for our todo lists. I piggybacked on it and created my own kanban board. Here is what it looks like.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-08-17-bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/board.png" title="Screenshot of the full JIRA board" ></p>

<h3>Mixing Project Stories And Personnal Tasks</h3>

<p>JIRA allows creating a kanban board that spans many projects ! You can simply choose multiple projects when you setup the board for the first time, or you can edit your board filter like this :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="n">project</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">POPIMDB</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">POPABTODO</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This makes it possible to see <em>all</em> of my work at a glance on the same board.</p>

<h3>Work In Progress Limit</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-08-17-bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/wip.png" title="Zoom on the wip constraints of the JIRA column" ></p>

<p>JIRA allows WIP limits, warning me with a red background when I am multitasking or when I am getting late on my tasks</p>

<h3>Color Conventions</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-08-17-bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/color-cards.png" title="Different colors of JIRA cards" ></p>

<p>JIRA makes it possible to assign different colors to cards, for example</p>

<ul>
<li>Red for tasks that are due soon</li>
<li>orange for cards that are due some time</li>
<li>light brown for project stories</li>
<li>green for other programming tasks</li>
<li>blue for other tasks</li>
</ul>


<h3>Swimlanes</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-08-17-bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/swimlanes.png" title="Closup on a JIRA swimlane" ></p>

<p>JIRA has swimlanes, separating project from personal tasks</p>

<h3>Reports</h3>

<p>An extra bonus with JIRA Kanban board is that they have reports ! Here is my cumulative flow diagram for my first week of usage :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-08-17-bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/cumulative-flow.png" title="A screenshot of the JIRA cumulative flow diagram" ></p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Here is the JQL query I used to configure it this way.</p>

<h2>The End Result</h2>

<p>By setting a WIP limit of 3 on the &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; column, the following naturally happened :</p>

<ul>
<li>Once I have started a programming task, I now defer any other activity in the TODO column until I am finished. (HINT: If you get invited to meetings all the time, lock your agenda with &lsquo;Unbookable&rsquo; days when you start programming)</li>
<li>It actually pushed me into finishing the <a href="https://github.com/philou/concurrency-kata">concurrency-kata</a> training I had started long ago.</li>
</ul>


<p>I also set a high WIP limit (around 10) on the TODO column, this way, I get a kind of warning that next time I finish a programming task, I should take some time off to prune the column.</p>

<p>The overall result is that I do lot less multitasking. I get the feeling of doing steadier, more efficient work.</p>

<p>If you are suffering from multitasking and decide to give it a try, I&rsquo;d love to read about your experience !</p>

<p>As you can see, I simply used Runnable as the type of the messages.</p>

<p>The Actor itself is Runnable, meaning that it can be submitted to the thread pool. When executed :</p>

<ol>
<li>it tries to handle a message from the mailbox if there is one.</li>
<li>It then re-submits the actor itself</li>
</ol>


<p>This ensures that only one thread is executing messages on an actor at a given time, and it also avoids spawning new thread for every new actor.</p>

<p>As an example, here is how I used this to make an actor of an existing InProcessChatRoom class.</p>

<p>ChatRoomActor is in fact some kind of proxy to use from other actors to send messages to the chat room.</p>

<p>As with any implementation of the Actors Model, the neet thing is the separation of threading and logic. That makes it so much simpler ! (You can get more detail about the complexity I am talking about by taking a look at the <a href="https://github.com/philou/concurrency-kata">concurrency-kata</a>)</p>

<h2>Performances</h2>

<p>Here is a performance summary of this implementation compared to others on a &ldquo;throughput vs clients&rdquo; benchmark of the style &ldquo;Enter while others are talking&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/philou/concurrency-kata"><img class="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philou/concurrency-kata/master/enter-while-others-are-talking.png" title="Result graphs of benchmark enter while others are talking" ></a></p>

<p>Results can be disappointing compared to other implementations but the example itself is a bit misleading. The chatroom does exclusively message passing, there is not much computation to parallelize, in a different setting, the results would have been completely different.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>As you can see, this implementation is just a quick prototype, nothing production ready. Here are the main limitations I can think of right now :</p>

<ul>
<li>It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting">Busy Waiting</a> for the next message, meaning that it consumes unnecessary resources, and that more important messages to other Actors might be delayed</li>
<li>Usually, actor messages are selected on their type rather than on their order of arrival, this is not the case here</li>
<li>The usage of the Runnable interface as base message type, though handy, opens the door to inter-thread calls that might violate the model altogether</li>
<li>There is absolutely no support of out of process actors until the messages are Serializable</li>
</ul>


<h2>Going Further</h2>

<p>I started this <a href="https://github.com/philou/concurrency-kata">concurrency-kata</a> as a training material about concurrency for colleagues at <a href="http://www.murex.com">work</a>. In the spirit of the coding kata, it&rsquo;s a git repo you can walk, explore and experiment with.</p>

<p>So if you want to learn more about different models of concurrency, you are welcome to have a look at the How-To section in the <a href="https://github.com/philou/concurrency-kata">README</a> file.</p>

<p>On my part, although it was a lot more work than I would have guessed at the beginning, I barely scratch the surface of the subject ! I could now :</p>

<ul>
<li>extract the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">CSP</a> or Actor implementation and make them more robust</li>
<li>practice and present the whole kata as a 2 hours live coding session</li>
<li>prepare a hands-on training about concurrency</li>
</ul>


<p>So, if you are willing to do any of the above you are welcome to contribute !</p>

    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/you-dont-have-to-ask-your-boss-for-a-fast-build-lean-software-development-part-6</id>
    <category term="agile" /><category term="lean" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A slow build costs money. I mean it costs <em>a whole lot of money all the time !</em></p>

<p>Spending some time to speed up the build is like an investment, you&rsquo;ll pay some money now, but then it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until you get a return on investment. Here is the trick, if you manage to get it quickly, no one will even notice that you spent some time making the build faster !</p>

<p>With a bit of maths, you can even get what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432909293&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=reinertsen+flow">Reinertsen</a> calls a &ldquo;Decentralized Decision Rule&rdquo;, making it possible for anyone in the organization to figure out if he should spend some time on the build or not; without the need to ask the permission to anyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_%28instrument%29"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-06-03-you-dont-have-to-ask-your-boss-for-a-fast-build-lean-software-development-part-6/Balance_ordinaire.jpg" title="A 2-pan balance (From Wikipedia)" ></a></p>

<h2>Our example</h2>

<p>Our team is constituted of 5 pairs, each running the build at least 10 times per day. Let&rsquo;s figure out the value of 1 minute build time speed-up</p>

<ul>
<li>The whole team would save : 1m x 5 pairs x 10 builds = 50 minutes per day</li>
<li>In a 2 weeks sprint, this would amount to around 1 day of work</li>
</ul>


<p>This means that if a pair spends half a day to get a 1 minute build speed-up, it would not change the output of the sprint, and it would in fact increase the throughput of the team for further sprints.</p>

<p>Anyone in our team that spots a potential 1 minute build time speed-up that would take less that 1 man.day to implement should do it right away, without asking the permission to anyone</p>

<h2>Other Benefits</h2>

<p>A direct benefit is that the issue will not have to be re-discussed every time someone spots a build time improvement. This will save some management time, and more build speed-up actions will eventually be undertaken.</p>

<p>The astute lean reader will have noticed that I completely ignored the second effect of fast feedback :</p>

<ul>
<li>if the build is faster</li>
<li>we will run it more often</li>
<li>we&rsquo;ll spot errors earlier</li>
<li>less errors will be submitted</li>
<li>the overall throughput will be increased even more</li>
</ul>


<p>Another hidden benefit concerns the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_delay">Cost of Delay</a> (the cost of not selling the product NOW). As Cost of Delay typically trumps the work costs, this means that any improvement to the build time will bring even greater ROI in the long term.</p>

<h2>Variations</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-06-03-you-dont-have-to-ask-your-boss-for-a-fast-build-lean-software-development-part-6/Boeing_777.jpg" title="A Boeing 777 in flight over the mountains (From Wikipedia)" ></a></p>

<p>If your sponsor agrees, you can negotiate a longer return on investment period for your decision rule. For example, if he agreed to increase the horizon to 2 sprints, we could undertake more build time speed-up tasks. You might also prefer only to discuss really long ROI investments with him.</p>

<p>While designing the 777 Boeing used a similar decision rule to meet the required weight of the plan : any engineer could increase the production cost of 300$ provided it saved a pound of weight on the plane. This fixed issues they previously had with department weight budgets and escalation.</p>

<p>Finally, it would be great if we had the same rule for technical debt ! Imagine that you knew both the costs of fixing and not fixing your technical debt, you could then decided whether it makes sense to work on the debt right now or not. But that&rsquo;s for a later experiment.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just discovered a hack to spread agile (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> by the way) through an organization. It works provided :</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a BDD testing expert in your team</li>
<li>Your team is using the work of another software team from your company</li>
</ul>


<p>If this team does not use agile practices, they are likely to regularly create regressions or to be late at providing new versions.</p>

<p>Use your client role in the relation, and propose your help ! Spend some time with them to help them put automated customer tests in place. Be genuinely nice with them, show example, be available and, obviously, bring improvement. With some chance, they might soon be asking for more.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-04-20-real-programmers-have-todo-lists/programmer.jpg" title="A programmer concentrating on his code" ></p>

<h2>Why is it so important</h2>

<p>As programmers, here is the typical internal discussion we have all day long :</p>

<blockquote><p>- Why the hell am I doing this again ?<br>
&hellip; hard thinking &hellip;<br>
- Yes ! I remember now :<br>
- Encapsulate this field<br>
- In order to move it to another class<br>
- In order to move this other function there too<br>
- In order to be able to remove that other static variable<br>
- In order to refactor the login module<br>
- In order to remove the dependency between the custom search query generator and the login module<br>
- In order to refactor the query generator<br>
- In order to be able to optimize it<br>
- In order to speed up the whole website !</p></blockquote>

<p>Phew, now that&rsquo;s a list ! A 9 frame stack, all in our heads, and that&rsquo;s only a simple example. Knowing that us humans usually have around 7 &lsquo;registers&rsquo; in our brains, this makes a lot of clutter to remember.</p>

<p>Maintaining all this in a todo list frees us some brainpower !</p>

<h2>What happens when you use a todo list</h2>

<p>Quite a lot in fact :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-04-20-real-programmers-have-todo-lists/check.gif" title="A tick in a check box" ></p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s satisfying to check something as done !</li>
<li>Our programming gets better, because we can fully concentrate on it</li>
<li>We have a clear idea about what&rsquo;s done, what&rsquo;s still to be done, and why we are doing it</li>
<li>We avoid getting lost in things that don&rsquo;t really need to be done</li>
<li>We can make better choices about what to do, what to postpone, and what not to do</li>
<li>We can make more accurate estimates about the time it will take to finish the job</li>
</ul>


<p>In the end, all this makes you feel less stressed and more productive !</p>

<h2>How to do it</h2>

<p>There are many ways to maintain a todo list. Which to choose is not as important as having one. Here are my 2 design principles for a todo list system :</p>

<ul>
<li>It goes in finer details than a typical bug tracking software</li>
<li>It should help you to concentrate on the few items you can do in the coming hours</li>
</ul>


<p>For example, I am now using a simple TODAY &hellip; TOMORROW &hellip; LATER &hellip; scheme. I tend to avoid deep hierarchies as it gets in the way of my second principle. I like to keep DONE items visible to keep track of what I did for up to 1 day.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-04-20-real-programmers-have-todo-lists/org-mode.jpg" title="A screen shot of my org-mode todo list" ></p>

<p>Here is a list of tools you can use to set up a todo list :</p>

<ul>
<li>Any text editor using a simple format convention will do</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> or any other synchronization tool can be helpful to access it from different places</li>
<li><a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> has built-in support for todo lists. It&rsquo;s a simple text file, but with color highlighting and shortcuts</li>
<li><a href="https://keep.google.com/">Google Keep</a> might do just fine for you</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> can also be useful, especially if you need to share your todo list with others (when pair programming for example)</li>
<li><a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> is also a good one, it can even be used as a personal kanban board</li>
<li>Any other todo list tool that suits you !</li>
</ul>


<p>If you are not already using a todo list, start now and become more productive ! No excuse !</p>

<p>EDIT 2015-08-18 : <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/bye-bye-programmers-todo-list-hello-personnal-kanban-on-jira/">I am now using Personnal Kanban instead of TODO lists</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a distributed team working from Paris and Beirut, after <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/">pair programming</a>, it was time for our retrospectives to get remote !</p>

<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/setup.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/setup-small.jpg" title="A remote retrospective meeting with Trello setup" ></a></p>

<h2>Initial setup</h2>

<p>At first we were using the visio conference system. The retrospective facilitator would connect with the remote participants through instant chat and forward theirs post-its. We also used an extra webcam connected to the laptop in order to show the whiteboard in the other room.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>Anyone can do it now</li>
<li>Kind of works</li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>We often used to loose 5 minutes setting all the infrastructure up</li>
<li>The remote room cannot see the board clearly through the webcam</li>
<li>The animator has to spend his time forwarding the other room&rsquo;s points</li>
<li>There is a &lsquo;master&rsquo; and a &lsquo;slave&rsquo; room</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sensei Tool</h2>

<p>When Mohamad joined the team in Beirut, we thought that this was not going to scale &hellip; We decided to try something else. With the availability of the new conferencing system, we had the idea to use a web tool to run the retro. We found and tried <a href="http://senseitool.com/">senseitool.com</a>. After creating accounts for every member of the team and scheduling a retrospective through the tool, we could all equally participate using our smartphones. The retrospective follows a typical workflow that is fine for teams new to the practice.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>Even easier to setup</li>
<li>Works fine</li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>The website was a bit slow</li>
<li>The retrospective was too guided for an experienced team, we did not get as good outputs as we used to</li>
<li>Everyone could participate as easily</li>
</ul>


<h2>Trello</h2>

<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/boat.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/boat-small.jpg" title="The boat activity on Trello" ></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.fr/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=remote%20retrospective">Asking Google</a>, we discovered that some teams were having success using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> for their remote retrospectives. We decided to give it a try. Ahmad from Beirut got to work on our first retrospective with it. He had to prepare it beforehand (as we always have been doing). In practice :</p>

<ul>
<li>Ahmad created an organization for our team</li>
<li>We all registered to Trello and joined the organization (we like joining (smile))</li>
<li>Ahmad created a custom board for each activity</li>
<li>During the meeting, we used the video conferencing system and the instant chat to have both visio and screen sharing</li>
<li>The animator used a laptop to manage the Trello boards</li>
<li>Everyone of us could add post-its through his smartphone app</li>
</ul>


<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>The setup is easy</li>
<li>The retrospective worked well and delivered interesting output</li>
<li>We actually all see the board</li>
<li>The smartphone app works well</li>
<li>It is possible to vote directly through Trello</li>
<li>Everyone could participate as easily</li>
<li>We can classify post-its with labels</li>
<li>We can insert pictures and photos</li>
<li>There are a lot of chrome extensions to Trello (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vertical-lists-for-trello/aldklnbenbdgfgfbflalmlddkkndgnlc?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog">Vertical Lists for Trello</a>), <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/card-color-titles-for-tre/hpmobkglehhleflhaefmfajhbdnjmgim?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog">Card Color Titles for Trello</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>There is nothing to &lsquo;group&rsquo; post its together</li>
<li>We need to prepare custom boards for every activity</li>
<li>We would need to pay for the gold version with custom backgrounds and stickers</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/roti.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-04-05-trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/roti-small.jpg" title="The Return On Time Invested activity on Trello" ></a></p>

<p>While missing a few features that would make it awesome, Trello is the best tool we found for remote retrospective, and is better than our initial physical setup. We&rsquo;re continuing to use it, and we now have to figure out</p>

<ul>
<li>If we could find a way to speed up the meeting preparation</li>
<li>How to handle &lsquo;graph oriented&rsquo; activities such as the &lsquo;5 whys&rsquo;</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2015-03-26T20:30:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/what-optimization-should-we-work-on-lean-software-development-part-5</id>
    <category term="agile" /><category term="lean" /><category term="performance" /><category term="xp" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At work, we are building a risk aggregation system. As it&rsquo;s dealing with a large bunch of numbers, it&rsquo;s a huge heap of optimizations. Once that its most standard features set is supported, our job mostly consists of making it faster.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s were we are now doing.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-03-26-what-optimization-should-we-work-on-lean-software-development-part-5/turtle.jpg" title="A turtle with a rocket on the back" ></p>

<h1>How do we choose which optimization to work on ?</h1>

<p>The system still being young, we have a wide range of options to optimize it. To name just a few : caches, better algorithms, better low level hardware usage &hellip;</p>

<p>It turns out that we can use the speedup factor as a substitute for business value and use known techniques to help us to make the best decisions.</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s walk through an example</h2>

<h3>I. List the optimizations you are thinking of</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose we are thinking of the following 3 optimizations for our engine</p>

<ul>
<li>Create better data structures to speed up the reconciliation algorithm</li>
<li>Optimize the reconciliation algorithm itself to reduce CPU cache misses</li>
<li>Minimize boxing and unboxing</li>
</ul>


<h3>II. Poker estimate the story points and speedup</h3>

<p>Armed with these stories, we can poker estimate them, by story points and by expected speedup.
As a substitute for WSJF, we will then be able to compute the speedup rate per story point.
We will then just have to work on the stories with the highest speedup rate first.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Title                   </th>
<th> Story Points  </th>
<th> /10    </th>
<th> /2     </th>
<th> -10%    </th>
<th> ~  </th>
<th> +10%   </th>
<th> x2      </th>
<th> x10     </th>
<th> Expected Speedup ratio* </th>
<th> Speedup rate / story point**</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Data Structures     </td>
<td> 13        </td>
<td>        </td>
<td>        </td>
<td>             </td>
<td>        </td>
<td> 4 votes</td>
<td> 5 votes </td>
<td>         </td>
<td> x 1.533                 </td>
<td> x 1.033</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Algorithm           </td>
<td> 13        </td>
<td>    </td>
<td> 1 vote </td>
<td> 1 vote      </td>
<td> 2 votes</td>
<td> 1 vote </td>
<td> 2 votes </td>
<td> 2 votes </td>
<td> x 1.799                 </td>
<td> x 1.046</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Boxing                  </td>
<td> 8     </td>
<td>    </td>
<td>        </td>
<td>             </td>
<td>        </td>
<td> 9 votes</td>
<td>         </td>
<td>         </td>
<td> x 1.1                   </td>
<td> x 1.012</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><sup><em>* Expected speedup ratio is the logarithmic average of the voted speedups</em></sup><br>
<sup><em>** Speedup rate is &ldquo;speedup<sup>(1/ story points)</sup>&rdquo;</em></sup></p>

<p>So based on speedup rate, here is the order in which we should perform the stories :</p>

<ol>
<li>Algorithm</li>
<li>Data Structures</li>
<li>Boxing</li>
</ol>


<h3>III. And what about the risks ?</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-03-26-what-optimization-should-we-work-on-lean-software-development-part-5/danger.jpg" title="A danger zone panel" ></p>

<p>This poker estimation tells us something else &hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>We don&rsquo;t have a clue about the speedup we will get by trying to optimize the algorithm !</p></blockquote>

<p>The votes range from /2 to x10 ! This is the perfect situation for an XP spike.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Title </th>
<th> Story points </th>
<th> Expected Speedup rate</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Algorithm spike : measure out of context CPU cache optimization speedup </td>
<td> 2 </td>
<td>   ?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br>


<p>In order to compute the expected speedup rate, let&rsquo;s suppose that they are 2 futures, one where we get a high speedup and another where we get a low one.</p>

<p>They are computed by splitting the votes in 2 :</p>

<ul>
<li><em>low_speedup = 0.846</em></li>
<li><em>high_speedup = 3.827</em></li>
</ul>


<h4>If the spike succeeds</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ll first work on the spike, and then on the algorithm story. In the end, we would get the speedup of the algorithm optimization.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>spike_high_speedup = high_speedup = 3.827</em></li>
</ul>


<h4>If the spike fails</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ll also start by working on the spike. Afterwards, instead of the algorithm story, we&rsquo;ll tackle another optimization stories, yielding our average speedup rate for the duration of the algorithm story. The average speedup rate can be obtained from historical benchmark data, or by averaging the speedup rate of the other stories.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>average_speedup_rate = (1.033 * 1.011)<sup>&frac12;</sup> = 1.022</em></li>
<li><em>spike_low_speedup = average_speedup_rate<sup>story_points</sup> = 1.02213 = 1.326</em></li>
</ul>


<h4>Spike speedup rate</h4>

<p>We can now compute the average expected speedup rate for the full period &lsquo;spike &amp; algorithm&rsquo; stories. From this we will be able to get the speedup rate and finally, to prioritize this spike against the other stories in our backlog.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>spike_speedup = (spike_low_speedup * spike_high_speedup)<sup>&frac12;</sup> = 2.253</em></li>
<li><em>spike_speedup_rate = spike_speedup<sup>1/(spike_story_points + algorithm_story_points)</sup> = 2.253<sup>1/(2 + 13)</sup> = 1.056</em></li>
</ul>


<h3>IV. Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Here are all the speedup rate for the different stories.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Title </th>
<th> Speedup rate / story point</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Data Structure  </td>
<td> x 1.033</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Algorithm           </td>
<td> x 1.046</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Boxing                  </td>
<td> x 1.012</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Algorithm spike         </td>
<td> x 1.056</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br>


<p>Finally, here is the optimal order through which we should perform the stories :</p>

<ul>
<li>Algorithm spike</li>
<li>Algorithm (only if the spike proved it would work)</li>
<li>Data Structures</li>
<li>Boxing</li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The math are not that complex, and a simple formula can be written to compute the spike speedup rate :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-03-26-what-optimization-should-we-work-on-lean-software-development-part-5/poc_speedup_rate.png" title="Formula for a spike speedup rate" ></p>

<p>I think most experienced engineers would have come to the same conclusion by gut feeling &hellip;</p>

<p>Nevertheless I believe that systematically applying the such method when prioritizing optimizations can lead to a greater speedup rate than the competition in the long run. This is a perfect example where taking measured risks can payoff !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently got hands on an abandonned laptop that was better than the one I was currently using for my personnal hackings, so I decided to switch to this one. I felt this was the time to learn Vagrant and save me some time later on. I settled on creating a <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> environment for this <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blogging. That proved a lot longer than I thought it would.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-03-20-setting-up-octopress-with-vagrant-and-rbenv/vagrant-octopress.png" title="Vagrant logo + Octopress logo" ></p>

<p>If you want to jump to the solution, just have a look at this <a href="https://github.com/philou/philou.github.com/commit/67b17f7702c213ff40313fc7bd0cbfa8a6e8e29b">git change</a>. Here is the slightly longer version.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a Vagrantfile and setup a VM. There are explainations about how to do this all over the web, that was easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Provision your VM. That proved a lot more complex. There are a lot of examples using variants of <a href="https://www.chef.io/">Chef</a>, but the steep learning curve for Chef seemed unneccessarily complex compared to what I wanted to do. Eventually, I figured it out using simple shell provisioning.</p></li>

<li><p>Setup port forwarding. That should have been simple &hellip; after forwarding port 4000 to 4000, I could still not manage to access my blog preview from the host machine. After searching throughout the web for a long time, I eventually fixed it with by adding <code>--host 0.0.0.0</code> to the rackup command line in <a href="https://github.com/philou/philou.github.com/commit/67b17f7702c213ff40313fc7bd0cbfa8a6e8e29b/Rakefile">Octopress Rackfile</a></p></li>
<li><p>Setup ssh forwarding. In order to be able to deploy to github pages with my local ssh keys, I added the following to my Vagrantfile.</p></li>

<li>Fix virtual box synced folder. When I tried to pimp my favicon up, changing the png in the host machine did not update it on the guest ! I lost almost 3 hours figuring this out &hellip; searching google, I eventually found that <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/virtualbox.html">Virtual Box synced folders can have issues</a>, and that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18933547/vagrant-virtualbox-shared-folder-out-of-sync-when-there-are-many-file-related">installing the guest additions is recommended</a>. For this, just enter the following in the command line from your project&rsquo;s working dir :</li>

<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you if this does not do the trick.</p>

<p>I admit it was a lot longer than I expected it to be, but at least now it&rsquo;s repeatable !</p>

<p><a href="http://docker.io"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-03-20-setting-up-octopress-with-vagrant-and-rbenv/docker.png" title="The Docker logo" ></a></p>

<p>Next steps will be to use <a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a> providers and Dockerfile to factorize provisioning and speedup up VM startup.</p>
