    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently got hands on an abandonned laptop that was better than the one I was currently using for my personnal hackings, so I decided to switch to this one. I felt this was the time to learn Vagrant and save me some time later on. I settled on creating a <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> environment for this <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blogging. That proved a lot longer than I thought it would.</p>

<p>If you want to jump to the solution, just have a look at this <a href="https://github.com/philou/philou.github.com/commit/67b17f7702c213ff40313fc7bd0cbfa8a6e8e29b">git change</a>. Here is the slightly longer version.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add a Vagrantfile and setup a VM. There are explainations about how to do this all over the web, that was easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Provision your VM. That proved a lot more complex. There are a lot of examples using variants of <a href="https://www.chef.io/">Chef</a>, but the steep learning curve for Chef seemed unneccessarily complex compared to what I wanted to do. Eventually, I figured it out using simple shell provisioning.</p></li>

<li>Setup port forwarding. That should have been simple &hellip; after forwarding port 4000 to 4000, I could still not manage to access my blog preview from the host machine. After searching throughout the web for a long time, I eventually fixed it with by adding <code>--host 0.0.0.0</code> to the rackup command line in <a href="https://github.com/philou/philou.github.com/commit/67b17f7702c213ff40313fc7bd0cbfa8a6e8e29b/Rakefile">Octopress Rackfile</a></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately <a href="http://www.murex.com">at work</a>, we&rsquo;ve unexpectedly been asked by other teams if they could use our product for something that we had not forseen. As we are not sure whether we&rsquo;ll be able to tune our product to their needs, we are thinking about doing a short study to know the answer. This looks like a great opportunity to try out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_delay">Cost of Delay</a> analysis about uncertain tasks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I cannot write the details of what we are creating at work in this blog, so let&rsquo;s assume that we are building a Todo List Software.</p>

<p>We have been targeting the enterprise market. Lately, we&rsquo;ve seen some interest from individuals planning to use our todo list system for themselves at home.</p>

<p>For individuals, the system would need to be highly available and live 24/7 over the internet, latency will also be critical to retain customers, but the product could get a market share with a basic feature set.</p>

<p>On the other side, enterprise customers need advanced features, absolute data safety, but they can cope with nightly restarts of the server.</p>

<p>In order to know if we can make our todo list system available and fast enough for the individuals market, we are planning to conduct a pre-study, so as not to waste time on an unreachable goal. In <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</a> terms, this is a <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html">spike</a>, and it&rsquo;s a bunch of experiments rather than a theoretical study.</p>

<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-31-measure-the-business-value-of-your-spikes-and-take-high-payoff-risks-lean-software-development-part-4/study.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-31-measure-the-business-value-of-your-spikes-and-take-high-payoff-risks-lean-software-development-part-4/study-petit.jpg" title="Photo of someone studying behind piles of books" ></a></p>

<h2>When should we prioritize this spike ?</h2>

<p>If we are using the <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/">Weighted Shortest Job First</a> metric to prioritize our work, we need to estimate the cost of delay of a task to determine its priority. Hereafter I will explain how we could determine the value of this spike.</p>

<h2>Computing the cost of delay</h2>

<p>The strategy to compute the cost of delay for such a risk mitigation task is to compute the difference in cost of delays with or without doing it.</p>

<h3>1. The products, the features, the MVP and the estimates</h3>

<p>As I explained in <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-measure-your-speed-with-your-business-value-lean-software-development-part-3/">a previous post</a>, for usual features, cost of delay is equivalent to it&rsquo;s value. Along with our gross estimates, here are the relative values that our product owner gave us for the different products we are envisioning.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature                   </th>
<th> $ Enterprise </th>
<th> $ Individuals </th>
<th> Estimated work</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<p><small>Stared (*) features are required for the first version of the product. Features with a value of 0 are not required for the product. Eventually, unstared features with a non null business value would be great for a second release.</small><br></p>

<p>It seems that the individuals market is a greater opportunity, so it&rsquo;s worth thinking about it. Unfortunately for the moment, we really don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll manage to get the high availability that is required for such a product.</p>

<p>The availability spike we are envisioning would take 1 unit of time.</p>

<h3>2. Computing the cost of delay of this spike</h3>

<p>The cost of delay of a task involving some uncertainty is the probabilistic expected value of its cost of delay. We estimate that we have 50% of chances of matching the availability required by individuals. It means that CoD of the spike = 50% * CoD if we match the latency + 50% CoD if we don&rsquo;t match the availability.</p>

<h4>2.a. The Cost of Delay if we get the availability</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the future in which we&rsquo;ll manage to reduce the latency.
The cost of delay of a spike task is the difference in Cost with and without doing the spike, per relevent months.</p>

<h5>2.a.i. The cost if we don&rsquo;t do the spike</h5>

<p>Unfortunately, at this point in this future, we don&rsquo;t yet know that we&rsquo;ll manage to get to the availability.</p>

<h5>2.a.iii. Cost of delay of the spike if we reach the availability</h5>

<p>By making the spike, we would save 2320 &ndash; 2175 = 145$</p>

<p>Without doing the spike, we would discover whether we would reach the availability when we try it, around time 7 (see 2.a.i).</p>

<p>So the cost of delay for the spike would be around 145/7 = 21 $/m</p>

<h4>2.b. The Cost of Delay if we don&rsquo;t get the availability</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s now consider the future in which we don&rsquo;t manage to increase the availability.</p>

<p>Using the same logic as before, let&rsquo;s now see what happens</p>

<h5>2.b.i. The cost if we don&rsquo;t do the spike</h5>

<p>Unfortunately, at this point in this future, we don&rsquo;t yet know that we&rsquo;ll not manage to get to the availability.</p>

<h5>2.b.ii. The cost if we do the spike</h5>

<br>


<h5>2.b.iii. Cost of delay of the spike if we reach the availability</h5>

<p>By making the spike, we would save 1122 &ndash; 896 = 226$</p>

<p>As before, without doing the spike, we would discover whether we would get the availability when we try it, around time 7.</p>

<p>So the cost of delay for the spike is around 226/7 = 32 $/m</p>

<h4>2.c. Compute overall Cost of Delay of the Spike</h4>

<p>Given that we estimate that there is a 50% chances of making the latency, the overall expected cost of delay is</p>

<p>50% * 21 + 50% * 32 = 26.5 $/m</p>

<p>Inject the spike in the backlog</p>

<p>With the Cost of Delay of the spike, we can compute it&rsquo;s WSJF and prioritize it against other features.</p>

<p>The spike comes at the top of our backlog. Which confirms our gut feeling.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Doing this long study confirmed classic rule of thumbs</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t develop many products at the same time</li>
<li>Do some Proof Of Concepts early before starting to work on uncertain features</li>
<li>Tackle the most risky features first</li>
</ul>


<p>By improving the inputs, we could get more quality results :</p>

<ul>
<li>If we had access to real sales or finance figures for the costs</li>
<li>If we did some sort of poker risk estimation instead of just guessing at 50% chances</li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously, the analysis itself is not perfect, but it hints to the good choices. And as <a href="http://reinertsenassociates.com/">Don Reinertsen</a> puts it, using an economical framework, the spread between people estimations goes down from <a href="http://leanmagazine.net/lean/cost-of-delay-don-reinertsen/">50:1</a> to 2:1 ! This seems a good alternative to the experience and gut feeling approach which :</p>

<ul>
<li>can trigger heated unfounded discussions</li>
<li>often means high dependence on the intuition of a single individual</li>
</ul>


<p>As everything is quantitative though, one could imagine that with other figures, we could have got to another conclusion, such as :</p>

<ul>
<li>The spike is not worth doing (it costs more than it might save)</li>
<li>The spike can wait a bit</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero</id>
    <category term="agile" /><category term="pair programming" /><category term="remote" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my team at <a href="http://www.murex.com">Murex</a>, we&rsquo;ve been doing Pair programming 75% of our time for the past 9 months now.</p>

<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-27-from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/real-teamwork.JPG"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-27-from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/real-teamwork.resized.JPG" title="Photo of all the team doing pair programming" ></a></p>

<p>Before I explain how we got there, let&rsquo;s summarize our observations :</p>

<ul>
<li>No immediate productivity drop</li>
<li>Pair programming is really tiring</li>
<li>Quality expectations throughout the team soared up</li>
<li>As a result, the quality actually increased a lot</li>
<li>But existing technical debt suddenly became incompatible with the team&rsquo;s own quality criterion. We went on to pay it back, which slowed us down for a while</li>
<li>Productivity is regularly going up as the technical debt is reduced</li>
<li>It helped us to define shared coding conventions</li>
<li>Pair programming is not for everyone. It has likely precipitated the departure of one team member</li>
<li>It certainly helped the team to <a href="http://www.hans-eric.com/2007/08/13/is-your-team-jelled/">jell</a></li>
<li>Newcomers can submit code on day 1</li>
<li>The skills of everyone increase a lot quicker than before</li>
<li><em>Bonus</em> : it improves personal skills of all the team members</li>
</ul>


<p>If you are interested in how we got there, read on, here is our story :</p>

<h2>Best Effort Code Reviews</h2>

<p>At the beginning, only experienced team members were reviewing the submitted code, and making remarks for improvement over our default review system : <a href="http://smartbear.com/product/collaborator/overview/">Code Collaborator</a>.</p>

<p>This practice revealed tedious, especially with large change lists. As it was not systematic, reviewers constantly had to remind to the reviewees to act on the remarks, which hindered empowerment.</p>

<h2>Systematic Code Reviews</h2>

<p>Observing this during a <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-we-introduced-efficient-agile-retrospectives/">retrospective</a>, we decided to do add code review to our <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Resources/Scrum-Glossary/Definition-of-Done">Definition Of Done</a>. Inspired by <a href="http://producingoss.com/en/setting-tone.html#code-review">best practices in the Open Source world</a>, we created a ruby review script that automatically creates Code Collaborator reviews based on the <a href="www.perforce.com">Perforce</a> submits. Everyone was made observer of any code change, and everyone was to participate in the reviews.</p>

<p>At first, to make this practice stick, a few benevolent review champions had to comment all the submitted code; once the habit was taken, everyone participated in the reviews.</p>

<p>Code Collaborator spamming was certainly an issue, but using Code Collaborator System Tray App helped each of us to keep up to date with the remaining reviews to do.</p>

<p><em>Bonus</em> : As everyone was doing reviews, and that reviews of small changes are easier, submits became smaller.</p>

<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-27-from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/code-collaborator.png"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-27-from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/code-collaborator.resized.png" title="A screenshot of our code collaborator installation" ></a></p>

<p>This was certainly an improvement, but it remained time consuming. We believed we could do better.</p>

<h2>Pair Programming</h2>

<p>After 1 or 2 months of systematic code reviews, during a retrospective (again) nearly all the team members decided to give <a href="http://blogs.sourceallies.com/2011/03/pair-programming-101/">pair programming</a> a try.</p>

<p>We felt the difference after the very first day : pair programming is intense, but the results are great. We never turned back.</p>

<p>With pair programming in place, we had to settle a pair switching frequency. We started with the full story, tried a one day rotation, and eventually settled on &ldquo;MIN(1 week, the story)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This is not set in stone and is team dependent. It may vary depending on the learning curve required to work on a story. We might bring it down later maybe.</p>

<h2>Remote Pair Programming</h2>

<p>Ahmad, a Murex guy from Beirut joined the team a few months ago. We did not want to change our way of working, and decided to try remote pair programming.</p>

<h3>Initial Setup</h3>

<p>At the beginning, we were using <a href="http://products.office.com/en-us/Lync/lync-2013-video-conferencing-meeting-software">Lync</a> (Microsoft&rsquo;s chat system) with webcams, headphones and screen sharing. It works, but Lync&rsquo;s screen sharing does not allow seamless remote control between Paris and Beirut. Here is how we coped with this :</p>

<ul>
<li>Only exceptionally use Lync&rsquo;s &ldquo;Give Control&rdquo; feature : it lags too much</li>
<li>Do small submits, and switch control at submits</li>
<li>When you cannot submit soon, shelve the code on perforce (you would just pull your buddy&rsquo;s repo with git), and switch control</li>
</ul>


<p>As a result, Ahmad became productive a lot more quickly. We are not 2 sub teams focusing on their own area of expertise, but 1 single distributed team sharing everything.</p>

<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-27-from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/remote-pairing-setup.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-27-from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/remote-pairing-setup.resized.jpg" title="My remote pair programming setup" ></a></p>

<h3>Improved Setup</h3>

<p>Remote pair programming as such is workable, but does not feel as easy as being collocated. Here are a few best practices we are now using to improve the experience :</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep your pair&rsquo;s video constantly visible : either on your laptop of in a corner of you main screen, but it&rsquo;s important to see his facial expression all the time</li>
<li>In order to allow eye contact, place your cam next to the window containing the video of your pair.</li>
<li>Using 2 cameras, <a href="http://download.manycam.com/">ManyCams</a> and a small whiteboard allows to share drawings !</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-27-from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/remote-pairing-screenshot.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-27-from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/remote-pairing-screenshot.resized.jpg" title="A screenshot of my pair programming environment" ></a></p>

<ul>
<li>We started using the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a> for control switching. <a href="http://www.marinaratimer.com/">MarinaraTimer</a> provides an online and shareable timer.</li>
<li>We also started maintaining a todo list with an online shareable editor such as <a href="http://collabedit.com/">CollabEdit</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Future Setup</h3>

<p>We are currently welcoming a new engineer in Beirut, and as we will be doing more remote pair programming, we&rsquo;ll need to make this more seamless. Control sharing and lag through Lync remain the main issues. We don&rsquo;t have a solution for that yet, but here are the fixes we are looking into</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.saros-project.org/">Saros</a> is an <a href="https://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> plugin for remote concurrent and real time editing of files. Many people can edit the files at the same time. We are waiting for the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij</a> version that is still under development</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.saros-project.org/screenshots"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-27-from-zero-to-pair-programming-hero/saros.resized.png" title="A screenshot from Eclipse with Saros plugin" ></a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://floobits.com/">Floobits</a> is a commercial equivalent of saros. We tried it and it seems great. It&rsquo;s not cheap though, especially with in-house servers.</li>
<li><a href="https://screenhero.com/">Screenhero</a> is a commercial low-lag, multi cursor screen sharing tool. Unfortunately, it currently does not work behind a proxy, and so we were not able to evaluate it yet.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>I believe that collocated, and remote, pair programming are becoming key skills for a modern software engineer.</p>

<p>I hope this will help teams envisioning pair programming. We&rsquo;d love to read about your best practices as well !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Making commitments to deliver software is always difficult. Whatever the margin you might take, it invariably seems wrong afterward &hellip;</p>

<p>Most Scrum, XP or Kanban litterature does not adress the issue, simply saying that commitment is not required, as long as you continuously deliver value (faster than your competition). That&rsquo;s kind of true, but sometimes you need commitments, for example if your customer is not yet ready to deploy your new software every friday worldwide &hellip;</p>

<p>So how can you do it while remaining agile ?</p>

<p>Grossly speaking, you have 2 options :</p>

<h2>Do it as usual</h2>

<p>Discuss with your experts, take some margin, do whatever voodoo you are used to. This will not be worse than it used to be. It might turn out better, thanks to your agile process, you should be able to deploy with a reduced the scope if needed.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-01-21-can-agile-teams-commit/voodoo.jpg" title="A guy entranced with voodoo" ></p>

<h2>Use your agile process metrics</h2>

<p>This technique is explained in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411140759&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile+development">The Art of Agile Development</a>, in section &ldquo;Risk Management&rdquo;, page 227.</p>

<p><em>As explained in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411140759&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile+development">The Art of Agile Development</a> page 227, these numbers com from <a href="http://www.systemsguild.com/riskology/">DeMarco&rsquo;s Riskology</a> system. Using XP practices means fixing all bugs at all iteration, sticking rigorously to DONE-DONE, and having a stable velocity over iterations.</em></p>

<p>This factor will account for unavoidable scope creep and wrong estimations.
* Use you iteration velocity to know how many sprints you&rsquo;ll need to finish.</p>

<h4>For example :</h4>

<p>Suppose you have 45 stories that account for a total of 152 story points, and that your velocity is 23 story points per iteration. You need to do a commitment, but hopefully, you are applying all the XP practices. So you can compute :</p>

<blockquote><p>Number of sprints = 152*1.8/23 = 12 sprints, (24 weeks, or about 5.5 months)</p></blockquote>

<h3>What about unknown risks ?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, using just the previous, you might miss some unavoidable important tasks you&rsquo;ll need to do before you can release. Think about monitoring tools and stress testing, when did your product owner prioritize these ? These are risk management activities that need to be added to your backlog in the first place. Here is how to list most of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do a full team brainstorming about anything that could possibly go bad for your project</li>
<li>For every item discovered, estimate

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s probability of occurrence (low, medium, high)</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s consequences (delay, cost, cancellation of the project)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For every item, decide whether to

<ul>
<li>avoid it : you have to find a way to make sure this will not happen</li>
<li>contain it : you&rsquo;ll deal with the risk when it occurs</li>
<li>mitigate it : you have to find a way to reduce it&rsquo;s impact</li>
<li>ignore it : don&rsquo;t bother with unlikely risks of no importance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, create stories to match your risk management decisions. These might be :

<ul>
<li>Monitoring systems helps to contain a risk</li>
<li>Logging helps to mitigate a risk</li>
<li>An automated scaling in script for situations of high demand helps both mitigate and contain the risk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simply add these stories to your backlog, and repeat the previous section. You can now make your commitment</li>
</ul>


<h2>Afterthoughts</h2>

<p>Contrary to the widespread belief, agile practices and metrics actually helps to make commitments.</p>

<p>It would be better if we had project specific statistics instead of generic risk multipliers. It&rsquo;s a shame that task tracking tools (JIRA &amp; friends) still don&rsquo;t help us with this.</p>

<p>We should keep in mind though, that estimating all your backlog in advance takes some time and is actually some kind of waste. If possible, just sticking to build (and sell) the thing that is the most useful now is more simple (<a href="http://vimeo.com/75196281">this guy calls it drunken stumble</a>).</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s in it for us ?</h1>

<p>If performance is indead a feature, then it can be managed like any feature :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It should result from use cases</p>

<blockquote><p>During use case X, the user should not wait more than Y seconds for Z</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>It can be split into user stories</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><ul>
<li>Story 1: During use case X, the user should not wait more than 2*Y seconds for Z</li>
<li>Story 2: During use case X, the user should not wait more than Y seconds for Z</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>They can be prioritized against other stories</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s forget about performance for now and deliver functionality A as soon as ready, we&rsquo;ll speed things up later.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s fix basic performance constraints for use case X for now, every story will have to comply with these constraints later.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The performance on these use cases should be automatically tested and non regressed</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><ul>
<li>If we slow things too much and these tests breaks, we&rsquo;ll have to optimize the code.</li>
<li>But as long as we don&rsquo;t break the tests, it&rsquo;s ok to unoptimize the code !</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a chance to stop performance related gut feeling quarrels !</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in agile software development, just read Kent Beck&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/B00CF6EJG8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417609208&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=embrace+change+1st+edition">Extreme Programming Explained : Embrace Change 1st edition</a>. It&rsquo;s only 200 pages, it was written in 1999, but it&rsquo;s still tremendously relevent, and it&rsquo;s got the highest ratio of information per page on the subject.</p>

<p>If you actually read it, you&rsquo;ll notice that Kent emphasizes about having food at the office. He claims that it improves the moral and builds team cohesion.</p>

<p>As my company already provides free drinks, my first attempt was to asked for weekly fresh fruits baskets. They are currently experimenting regular self service fruit baskets deliveries in some offices. Unfortunately not in ours yet. Let&rsquo;s hope it changes soon. Meanwhile, we decided to handle the thing ourselves.</p>

<h2>Here comes the fruit basket lean startup !</h2>

<h3>First, let&rsquo;s setup the simplest way it could possibly work</h3>

<ul>
<li>Invest 10€</li>
<li>Buy some fruits from the closest shop</li>
<li>Put them in a basket next to my desk</li>
<li>Let people buy them for 50c each</li>
<li>Leave a plastic cup next to the basket to receive the money</li>
<li>Hold the accounting public and visible in your wiki for example</li>
<li>Repeat every monday</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-12-17-how-to-setup-a-weekly-fruit-basket-in-no-time/fruits-basket.jpg" title="&#34;Our fruit basket at my desk&#34;" alt="&#34;Our fruit basket at my desk&#34;"></p>

<h3>Then, verify that it is sustainable</h3>

<p>It turns out it works fine !</p>

<h3>&hellip; Until someone started to steal some money !</h3>

<p>If we forgot to hide the money cup before we left in the evening, obvious isn&rsquo;t it ?
We tried the following, in that order :</p>

<ol>
<li>Setup an automatic reminder to hide the money before leaving &hellip; FAIL</li>
<li>Setup a fake webcam and a warning notice &hellip; FAIL</li>
<li>Only keep 1€ worth of change in the money cup, and repeatedly lock up the rest in a safe place &hellip; SUCCESS !</li>
</ol>


<p>With just a bit of time, anyone, anywhere can setup a fresh fruit basket at work. It does improve the moral and build the team.</p>

    <category term="agile" /><category term="business-value" /><category term="lean" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a french idiom that basicaly is</p>

<blockquote><p>No use to run, all that is needed is to start on time &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>an agile engineer would add</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip; and to go in the good direction</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, velocity or mean cycle time as speed measures have their shortcomings :</p>

<ul>
<li>Can be falsified by story point inflation !</li>
<li>Does not tell the team or its product owner whether they are working on the right thing.</li>
</ul>


<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if we could track the business value we are creating instead ? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more motivating for developpers to know how they are contributing to the bottom line ? Wouldn&rsquo;t it help various people to align inside the organization ?</p>

<h2>How to track and prioritize based on your business value</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Principles-Product-Development-Flow/dp/1935401009/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413953773&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=product+development+flow">Reinertsen&rsquo;s Flow book</a>, we learned that the cost of delay is the main driver of the value creation : the faster you deliver a feature, less you spend the cost of delay of that feature, the more value you are creating for your company. <a href="http://scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/">This article</a> suggests that the cost of delay can be computed with the following formula :</p>

<blockquote><p>cost of delay = f(user business value) + g(time criticality) + h(risk reduction opportunity)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/jchyip/estimating-cost-of-delay/27">This other article</a> suggests that they are different types of tasks that corresponds to the different terms of the formula above.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-10-16-how-to-measure-your-speed-with-your-business-value-lean-software-development-part-3/task-types.jpeg" title="&#34;Different kind of tasks&#34;" alt="&#34;Different kind of tasks&#34;"></p>

<p>Here is how we could link the 2 articles :</p>

<ul>
<li>Stories with deadlines : either through legal or market constraints, not doing this will put you out of business (&lsquo;time criticality&rsquo; in the formula)</li>
<li>Stories that influence the bottom line : by increasing the sales figures when delivered, or decreasing them when not delivered, which is kind of the same (&lsquo;user business value&rsquo; in the formula)</li>
<li>Risk reduction tasks : by mitigating risk or streamlining the process, these tasks actually improve the bottom line of other stories (&lsquo;risk reduction opportunity&rsquo; in the formula)</li>
</ul>


<p>The later type of task will be detailed in other articles. Let&rsquo;s focus on the two others.</p>

<h2>The case of the deadlined feature ?</h2>

<p>First, I&rsquo;d say its business value is 0, until it&rsquo;s too late. You should not be working on it too soon, but you should not be working on it too late neither !</p>

<p>In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413954965&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile+development">The Art of Agile Development</a> James Shore details in great details how an agile team can commit to deliverables (I really recommend this part, I might even write a post about it). He explains that in order to commit, teams should multiply their estimates by 4, or by 1.8 if they are very rigourous in their application of all the XP practices.</p>

<p>So a rule to handle such a task could be to</p>

<ul>
<li>estimate it</li>
<li>multiply that estimate by 4</li>
<li>substract this time from the deadline</li>
<li>prioritize it so that it can be started at that date, but not earlier</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t expect to be creating any value by completing these stories</li>
</ul>


<h2>What&rsquo;s the business value of other typical user stories</h2>

<p><a href="http://scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/">This article</a> suggests that in this case the cost of delay is equal to the business value of the feature for the user. But how can we have an idea of its actual user business value ?</p>

<p>Before actually selling and getting the money, it&rsquo;s just an estimation. With the good information, some people will make better estimates than others, never the less, it&rsquo;s still an estimate. Let&rsquo;s try a &ldquo;Business Value Poker&rdquo; ! Here are a few ideas about how to conduct this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Estimate business value at the same time as you estimate the complexity of a story</li>
<li>Create some business value $ poker estimate cards, write an app for this, or bring in some Poker Chips to estimate the value</li>
<li>Invite some business people (sales, marketting &hellip;) to the meeting to get real knowledge (being organized as a feature team will help)</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://gigaom.com/2012/05/16/social-gaming-to-gambling-states-inch-forward/poker-chips-by-sanzar-murzin/"><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-10-16-how-to-measure-your-speed-with-your-business-value-lean-software-development-part-3/all-in.jpg" title="&#34;Hands pushing poker chips for an all-in&#34;" alt="&#34;Hands pushing poker chips for an all-in&#34;"></a></p>

<p>At the end, when you have the estimated cost of delay and duration of every task, you can directly prioritize using the WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) :</p>

<blockquote><p>WSJF = Cost of Delay / Duration</p></blockquote>

<p>Just do the tasks by decreasing order of WSJF.</p>

<p>At the end of the sprint, just as we track the story points we completed with the velocity, we could track the business value we created, that would be our business value speed. If you have access to real sales numbers, it might be interesting to see if it&rsquo;s possible to correlate the figures.</p>

<h2>Afterthoughts</h2>

<p>The more I learn about Lean principles, the more I find our current Issues Tracking Systems (I&rsquo;m used to Jira) limited. They seem to be databases with a nice UI, whereas what we need are tools to help us to make better decisions out of the multitude of items &hellip; How come they do not provide something as simple as the WSJF ?</p>

<h2>Edit 12/09/2014</h2>

<p>I got some pretty positive feedback from practicing these business value pokers. Inviting the product owner forced him to explain in details why he believed some features were more valuable than others. On the opposite, it allowed the developpers to hightlight how some seemingly unimportant stories were critical to a long term goal. In the end, everyone, including the product owner, is asking for more. It&rsquo;s a good practice that helps introducing the business value / cost of delay concept.</p>

    <category term="agile" /><category term="lean" /><category term="xp" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming for quite some time now, in different teams, using various methodologies. I also had the luck to do XP for at least 3 different projects. To me the conclusion is obvious, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">XP</a> delivers more. Even better, programmers working with XP seem to be happier. The only thing I&rsquo;ve seen that works better than XP, is fine tunning it once the team has mastered the main principles.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-09-11-whats-in-kent-becks-extreme-programming-lean-diet-lean-software-development-part-2/lean-extreme.jpg" title="&#34;An extreme diet pill bottle&#34;" alt="&#34;An extreme diet pill bottle&#34;"></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming#History">XP was first put in place</a> at the Chrysler C3 project for SmallTalk performance issues. After being called for performance issues, <a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/">Kent Beck</a> discovered that these were only the tip of the iceberg, everything was going astray. As the expert in the room, people started to ask him how to organize. I remember reading some time ago that without having thought about it before, he gathered all the most efficient programming techniques he knew together into a new process. XP was born.</p>

<p>So the question is : what did Kent Beck put in XP so that it works so well ? Let&rsquo;s go through the Flow book and its 175 lean product development principles, to see if we get some explanations.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-09-11-whats-in-kent-becks-extreme-programming-lean-diet-lean-software-development-part-2/circles.jpg" title="Concentric circles featuring the 12 core xp practices&#34;" alt="Concentric circles featuring the 12 core xp practices&#34;"></p>

<p>Going through <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices">the 12 core XP practices</a>, the main Scrum ceremonies and a few common additions, I&rsquo;ll try to explain why they work through the Flow book&rsquo;s principles.</p>

<h2>Whole Team</h2>

<p>This is the same thing as Pizza Team, Feature team, Cross Functional Team. It just means put everyone involved in the creation of the product in the same room (On site customer, sales, product people, programmers, quality controllers, operation people &hellip;).</p>

<h2>Planning Game</h2>

<p>The work is split into user stories. The customer then estimates the business value of each story, before the programmers poker estimate the required work for them. The game is then to maximize the scheduled business value creation for the coming iteration (1 to 3 weeks).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Whaoo that&rsquo;s a lot ! I did not expect to find so many principles underlying XP (I even removed principles that were not self explanatory). For the XP practitioner that I am, writing this blog post helped me to deepen understanding of it. As XPers know, XP is quite opiniated, it&rsquo;s both a strength and a weakness if you try to apply it outside of its zone of comfort. This explains why some lean subjects are simply not addressed by XP.</p>

<p>To summarize, here is where XP hits the ground :</p>

<ul>
<li>In spite of its image of &lsquo;a process for nerdy programmers&rsquo; XP turns out to be a quite evolved lean method !</li>
<li>XP anihilates batch size and feedback time</li>
<li>Pair programming is well explained</li>
</ul>


<p>And here is where to look at when you&rsquo;ll need to upgrade XP</p>

<ul>
<li>Better tradeoffs might be found with a real quantitative economical framework</li>
<li>Synchronization principles might help working with other teams</li>
</ul>


<p>Kent Beck could not have read the Flow book when he invented XP, but it seems he just had a bit of advance on the rest of us &hellip;</p>

<p>This was part 2 of my <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/the-flow-book-summary-lean-software-development_part_1/">suite of article about Lean Software Development</a>, Part 1 was <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/the-flow-book-summary-lean-software-development_part_1/">The Flow book summary</a>, Part 3 will be <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-measure-your-speed-with-your-business-value-lean-software-development-part-3/">How to measure your speed with your business value ?</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Principles-Product-Development-Flow/dp/1935401009">The principles of product development flow</a> from Donald G. Reinertsen.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-08-29-the-flow-book-summary-lean-software-development_part_1/flow_book_cover.jpg" title="The cover of the book" ></p>

<p>I read it both for work and for my side projects, and I think it will be useful for both. The book is about lean product development, and is in fact a collection of 175 lean principles that one can study and understand in order to make better decisions when developing new products. The principles are divided into the following 8 categories</p>

<ol>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Queues</li>
<li>Variability</li>
<li>Batch sise</li>
<li>WIP constraints</li>
<li>Cadence, synchronization and flow control</li>
<li>Fast feedback</li>
<li>Decentralized control</li>
</ol>


<p>I really loved the book. I have not been thrilled like that by a book since <a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/">Kent Beck</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416">1st edition of Extreme Programming Explained</a>. Where Kent Beck described some values, principles and practices that work. D.G. Reinertsen has the ambition to help us to quantify these practices in order not move from belief based to fact based decisions. For this, he gives us the keys to creating an economical framework with which we should be able to convert any change option to its economical cost</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-08-29-the-flow-book-summary-lean-software-development_part_1/xp_book_cover.jpg" title="The cover of the book &#34;Extreme Programming Explained&#34;" alt="The cover of the book &#34;Extreme Programming Explained&#34;"></p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking of an economical framework of my own, that I could use on the projects I am currently involved in. This post is the first of a series about this :</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I&rsquo;ve encountered this situation in different disguise in different companies, I now assume it&rsquo;s a widely applied antipattern.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>A team of programmers inherits a piece of code from one of their bosses. They find it really difficult to maintain : it is difficult to understand, fix, and change.</p>

<h3>The Antipattern</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-08-10-the-holy-code-antipattern/grenade.jpg" title="A picture from the Monty Python's Holy Grail movie featuring the holy hand grenade of antioch" ></p>

<p>As this piece of code seems too complex to be maintained by a team of simple programmers, as the boss, just forbid them :</p>

<ul>
<li>to refactor any part of it</li>
<li>to rewrite it from scratch</li>
<li>to use something else instead</li>
</ul>


<h3>Consequences</h3>

<ul>
<li>This often limits the number of bugs that appear in this library, but &hellip;</li>
<li>It slows down development, because of the micro management required to enforce this pattern</li>
<li>It frustrates programmers, and it is likely that the best ones will leave</li>
<li>It prevents better design</li>
<li>Even worse, in the long run, it prevents great domain driven design to emerge from merciless refactoring</li>
<li>In the end, it makes the whole organization less performant</li>
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Your boss wrote something a few years ago, if the domain is more or less complex, the resulting code <em>is</em> complicated. The subject eventually got the reputation of being &lsquo;touchy&rsquo;. Your boss is the only person who effectively manages to change anything in there. He&rsquo;s a bit afraid that by trying to improve it, the whole thing might just break down and become a bug nest. So, now that he has some authority, he forbids anyone to touch it. If a change is finally required, he&rsquo;ll micro manage it !</p></li>
<li><p>Your big boss spent some over time on writing an uber-meta-generic-engine to solve <del>the universe and</del> everything. After seeing many developpers fixing the same kind of bugs over and over, he decides that it&rsquo;s time to remove the dust from his compiler and that he starts building something that should solve the root cause of all these. In the spirit of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second system effect</a>, he adds all bells and whistle to his beloved project, trying to incorporate a solution to every different issue he has seen during the last decade. This code grows and grows in total isolation of any real working software. When he eventually thinks it is ready, he justs drops the whole thing to your team, that is now responsible to integrate and use this thing in the running system. He&rsquo;s micro managing the whole thing, and you don&rsquo;t have any choice but to comply and succeed. This usually generates gazillions of bugs, makes projects really late and ruins the developpers&#8217; lives.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Alternatives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use collective code ownership so that knowledge about the code is shared by design</li>
<li>Trust programmers to design and architecture the system</li>
<li>Use constant refactoring to let tailor made domain driven designs emerge from the system</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2014-06-27T06:33:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/rip-mes-courses-dot-fr</id>
    <category term="lessons-learned" /><category term="mes-courses" /><category term="side project" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rest In Peace <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/206938/mes-courses.fr/archives/index.html">mes-courses.fr</a>. Here is what it looked like :</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-06-27-rip-mes-courses-dot-fr/screenshot.png" title="Screen shot of the home page of mes-courses.fr" ></p>

<p>I wanted to create a really fast on-line grocery front-end, where people could shop for the week in only 5 minutes. It supported shopping recipes instead of individual items but I also envisioned to allow automatic menus recommendations, and automatic item preference selection. I started 4 years ago, and this is my last doing on the subject :). If you&rsquo;re thinking about starting your own side project, this post is for you.</p>

<h3>Here are the lessons I learned</h3>

<ul>
<li>As a professional programmer, I largely underestimated the non programming time required for a serious side project. It represents more than half the time you&rsquo;ll spend on your project (marketing, discussing with people, mock ups and prototypes)</li>
<li>When I started, I kind of estimated the time it would take me to build a first prototype. Again I ridiculously underestimated this :

<ul>
<li>because of the previous point</li>
<li>because on a side project, you&rsquo;ll be on your own to handle any infra issue</li>
<li>because you don&rsquo;t have 8 hours per day to spend to your project (As a professional developer, dad of 2, I only managed to get 10 to 15 hours per week)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/programming-as-an-exponential-problem/">A small project does not require as much infrastructure as a big one</a>. I lost some time doing things as I do when working on projects with more than 100K lines of code. So next time :

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll stick to end to end cucumber tests for as long as possible</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll use an economical framework like described in <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/The-Principles-Product-Development-Flow/dp/1935401009">Donald G. Reinertsen&rsquo;s Flow book</a> to prioritize improvements vs features</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eventually, what killed me was that I could not go around the &ldquo;experiment &ndash;> adapt&rdquo; loop fast enough. The project was just too big for my time

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll try to select a subject a project that suits my constraints of time and money</li>
<li>This will be one of the first hypotheses that I&rsquo;m willing to verify</li>
<li>Web marketing and HTML design are more important than coding skills to run experiments : I&rsquo;m learning both</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scrapping is a time hog. I won&rsquo;t start any side project involving scrapping anymore.</li>
<li>Using on-line services always saved me a lot of time. They are a lot more reliable than anything I could setup. Mainly, this was :

<ul>
<li>Mailing services</li>
<li>Cloud deployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go the standard way. Again, anytime I did something a bit weird, it turned out to cost me some time

<ul>
<li>Use standard open source software, stick to the latest version</li>
<li>Use standard and wide spread technology</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automated testing and deployment saved me some time from the start. Especially with the small amount of time that I could spend on my project, it was really easy to forget details and to make mistakes.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/blob/master/lib/mes_courses/deployment.rb">Here</a> is the <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> deployment script I used to test and deploy in a single shell call</li>
<li>And <a href="https://github.com/philou/mes-courses/blob/master/lib/mes_courses/utils/scheduled_tasks.rb">here</a> is a Heroku workaround to run some cron tasks weekly, this allowed me to run some scrapping tests every week on Heroku</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It took all my time ! Next time I start a side project, I&rsquo;ll be prepared to

<ul>
<li>Spend all my free time on it (my time was divided between day-job, family, side project)</li>
<li>Spend all my learning time (books, on-line trainings &hellip;) for it</li>
<li>Choose something that I am passionate about !</li>
<li>Choose a different kind of project to fit my constraints

<ul>
<li>Joining an existing open source project would let me focus on technical work at my own pace</li>
<li>Volunteer for a not for profit project might be less time intensive while allowing some fulfilment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I did my project alone, and it was hard to keep my motivation high on the long run. Next time :

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll join someone else</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/my-own-side-project-best-practices-after-reading-the-side-project-book/">time box my project</a> before a pivot or starting something completely different</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I did not manage to get anything done before I settled a regular daily rhythm. I used to work from 5:30am to 7:30am, I first tried in the evening, but after a day&rsquo;s work, I was too tired to be really productive.</li>
<li>When I could afford it, paying for things or services really saved me some time. I&rsquo;m thinking of

<ul>
<li>A fast computer</li>
<li>Some paying on-line services</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>It is sure that doing a side project seriously is a heavy time investment, but there&rsquo;s also a lot of benefits !</p>

<h3>Here is what I gained</h3>

<ul>
<li>Real experience with new technologies. For me, this included

<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Coffeescript</li>
<li>HTML scrapping</li>
<li>Dev-ops practices with Heroku</li>
<li>Web design with HTML and CSS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I also learned a lot of non technical skills in which I was completely inexperienced

<ul>
<li>Web marketing</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Mailing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trying to bootstrap a for profit side project is like running a micro company, it&rsquo;s a good opportunity to understand how a company is ran. This can help you to become a better professional during your day-job.</li>
<li>Having control on everything is a good situation to use Lean techniques.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404024050&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lean+startup">Lean Start-up</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Principles-Product-Development-Flow/dp/1935401009/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404024094&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=reinersten">Lean product development (Donald G. Reinertsen)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failing allowed me to actually understand Lean Start up ! The ideas are easy to understand in theory, the practice is a very different thing. It should help me for my next project.</li>
<li>Resolving real problems on my own was a very good source for valuable blog articles.</li>
<li>I collaborated with very clever people on open source libraries

<ul>
<li>By fixing some bugs in some libraries I was using</li>
<li>By releasing some parts of my code as open source libraries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Next time, I hope I&rsquo;ll get more euros as well !</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got nothing to loose from trying ! Just do it. Give yourself 1 year to get some small success, and then continue or repeat with something else !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everybody knows about the agile software development promise &ldquo;Regularly and continuously deliver value&rdquo;. This is how it is supposed to work :</p>

<ul>
<li>Iterative</li>
<li>Focusing on what is needed now</li>
<li>Release as soon as possible</li>
<li>Planning small stories according to the team&rsquo;s velocity</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-06-15-enabling-agile-practices-and-elephant-taming/squirrel.jpg" title="A business A squirrel jumping from one tree to another (source mayamumu.centerblog.net)" ></p>

<p>It all seems common sense and simple. Especialy for people who don&rsquo;t code. That&rsquo;s not the whole story though, let&rsquo;s have a look at a few variations :</p>

<p>Suppose a team uses <a href="http://www.scrum.org">Scrum</a> but does not do any automated testing. As soon as the software will be used, bugs will create havoc in the planning. The velocity will quickly fall, within a few monthes, the team won&rsquo;t be able to add any value. Surely, things could be improved with some rewrite and upfront design &hellip; this does not sound like Scrum anymore.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s suppose that another team is also using Scrum, uses automated tests, but <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/sprints-are-not-sprints/">missunderstood Sprint</a> and KISS for quick-and-dirty-coding. Hopefully, this team won&rsquo;t get too many bugs in production ! Unfortunately, any change to the source code will trigger hundreds of test failures : again, the velocity will decrease. I&rsquo;ve been in such projects, in about 2 years, the team got really slow, and might eventually drop their test suit &hellip;</p>

<p>These two examples show that automated testing improves the situation, but also that it is not enough ! There are quite a few agile practices that are in fact <em>enabling</em> practices. These are the practices that are required for the process to accomplish the agile promise described at the begining of this article. Most come from <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> and have been reincarnated through <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship</a>. That&rsquo;s what Kent Beck meant when he said that XP practices reinforce each other. Here are a few examples :</p>

<p>For example let&rsquo;s take <strong>coding standards</strong> and <strong>pair programming</strong> which really seem to be a programmer choice.
It turns out that they help to achieve <strong>collective code ownership</strong>.
Which in turn helps to get &lsquo;switchable&rsquo; team members.
Which helps to make good team estimates.
Which is required to have have a reliable <strong>velocity</strong>.
Which is a must have to regularly <strong>deliver value</strong> on commitment !</p>

<p>It turns out that all of the other original <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">XP practices</a> help to achieve the agile promise.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-06-15-enabling-agile-practices-and-elephant-taming/elephant-in-the-room.jpg" title="A business meeting with a real elephant in the room" ></p>

<p>After a lot of time spent writing software, I now tend to think of the code as the elephant in the room. It directly or indirectly constrains every decision that is make. Recognize and tame your elephant or you&rsquo;ll get carted away &hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip; or dragged away &hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip; or trampled &hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just compiled my Gherkin and Cucumber goodies into a gem. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/cucumber_tricks">cucumber_tricks</a> and the source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/philou/cucumber_tricks">github</a>.

<p>The goal of all these tricks is to be able to write more natural english scenarios. Here is an extract from the readme of the gem, which explains what it can do :</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I already wrote a lot about test proxies (<a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-stub-around-a-call-to-the-original-method-with-rspec/">here</a>, <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/hitting-the-middle-ground-between-classicist-and-mockist-tdd/">here</a> and <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/my-humble-advices-about-how-to-write-maintainable-tests/">here</a>).</p>

<p>I just took the time to transform my previous gist in a full fledged ruby gem. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;rspecproxies&rdquo; and it can be found <a href="https://github.com/philou/rspecproxies">on github</a>. It&rsquo;s fully tested, documented and there&rsquo;s a usage section in the readme to help anyone get started.</p>

<p>Here are the pain points proxies try to fix :</p>

<ul>
<li>Without mocks, it is sometimes just awfully painfull to write the test (do you really want to start a background task just to get a completion ratio ?)</li>
<li>With classic stubs, you sometimes have to stub things you are not interested in in your test, you end up with unmaintainable extra long stub setup</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at a few examples of tests with proxies :</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify actual load count without interfering in any behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;d really love to see more code tested with proxies, it makes the whole testing so much more natural. As with any testing techniques, we get more thorough testing from the ease of writing the test.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When testing html views, either from <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> or from <a href="http://rspec.info/">Cucumber</a>, <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath">XPath</a> can be really helpful to quickly find expected elements.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a bit like regular expressions, when you start to use xpath to solve a problem, you often end up with 2 problems &hellip; Part of the reason is that xpaths tend to be cryptic. In the case of testing, error messages coming from unmatched xpath are even more crytic !</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I had the idea for <a href="https://github.com/philou/xpath-specs">xpath-specs</a> : a small gem that allows to associate a description with an xpath, to nest xpaths together, all this to simplify tests and assertion failure reporting.</p>

<p>For example, with an assertion like this :</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">html</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">contain_a</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dish_with_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Grilled Lobster&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/refactoring-trick-to-insert-a-wrapper</id>
    <category term="anticorruption layer" /><category term="refactoring" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week at work, we decided that we needed an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/909264/ddd-anti-corruption-layer-how-to">Anticorruption Layer</a> between our code and another team&rsquo;s. They have been using our internal data structures as they needed to, in an ad hoc way. This turned out to be an issue when we want to refactor our code. The goals of this layer are :</p>

<ul>
<li>to provide an explicit API layer, controlling what is accessible from the outside</li>
<li>to allow us to improve our implementation independently of this API</li>
</ul>


<p>The first step all the team aggreed on is to provide direct wrappers around our classes. Unfortunately, some of these classes had more than a thousand references to it and our IDE does not provide any automated refactoring for this (introduce a wrapper class, and only use it in some part of the code). We found a trick ! Here it is :</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have a clean SCC state</li>
<li>Rename the class to be wrapped (let&rsquo;s call it Foo) into FooWrapper</li>
<li>From SCC, revert the part of the code where you want to continue using Foo directly</li>
<li>In SCC, revert Foo and FooWrapper</li>
<li>Manually (re)create the FooWrapper class</li>
<li>Create FooWrapper.wrap(x) and FooWrapper.unwrap(x) methods</li>
<li>Fix all the compilation issues (mostly by calling wrap() and unwrap())</li>
<li>Run your tests and fix any remaining points</li>
</ol>


<p>That saved us a whole lot of time. If your layer contains several classes with references between them, they is an optimal order through which to introduce the wrappers. Any order will work, but some will require more temporary calls to wrap and unwrap (step 7.). At the end, wrap() and unwrap() methods should only be called from within the layer.</p>

<p>Often you&rsquo;ll find out that to complete the wrapping of a class, you&rsquo;ll first need to wrap another class, you can :</p>

<ul>
<li>Follow the mikado method strictly : upgrade your mikado graph, revert all your changes, and try to wrap this other class. It can seem slow, but it is completly incremental</li>
<li>Wrap the 2 classes at the same time : this is the best way when wrapping this other class is rather straightforward</li>
<li>Insert temporary calls to wrap() and unwrap() : they&rsquo;ll be removed when you&rsquo;ll later wrap the other class. This might be the only way if the classes have cyclic dependencies.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2014-04-22T06:13:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippe.bourgau.net/how-we-introduced-efficient-agile-retrospectives</id>
    <category term="agile" /><category term="retrospectives" /><category term="scrum" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>6 months ago, our team started to run systematic iteration retrospectives. Within these 6 months, our team became more agile than ever. Running efficient retrospectives is what makes good teams great, it is what truly makes a team agile. Here is our story.</p>

<p>At the begining, we started with a standard retrospective format inspired from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398141097&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+agile+development">The Art Of Agile Development</a> (A truly great book by the way). As I was used to running retrospectives, I did the first one. This is how it goes :</p>

<ul>
<li>Repeat Norm&rsquo;s Kerth&rsquo;s prime directive to everyone (5 minutes) :</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Regardless of what we discover today, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the message is awkward, the animator can explain that the point is to avoid counter productive blaming (even if it is unlikely to happen in your setting &hellip;)</p>

<ul>
<li>Do some kind of brainstorming (10 minutes) :</li>
</ul>


<p>One his own, everyone writes what went well on green post-its, and what did not went so well on blue post-its. Everybody sticks them up on the flipchart.</p>

<ul>
<li>Group insights togethers (15 minutes) :</li>
</ul>


<p>The animator reads every post-it aloud, asking team members for details, and tries to group notes together. When everyone is ok with the groups, dot vote : every team member gets 3 points, that he can assign as he wishes on any group. Here is what the board should look like at this point.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-04-22-how-we-introduced-efficient-agile-retrospectives/insights.jpg" title="Photo of the flipchart with gathered insights" ></p>

<ul>
<li>Find actions to improve the process (30 minutes) :</li>
</ul>


<p>Pick up the 3 most voted issues, give everyone 5 minutes to think of useful actions to fix these. Then take another 5 minutes so that people can discuss their solutions in pairs, and another 5 minutes to do the same in groups of 4. Eventually, as the animator reports on the flipchart, do the same altogether. Make sure that the solutions are <strong>doable</strong> within the next sprint, if not discuss and split them until they are. Again, dot vote for the prefered actions.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2014-04-22-how-we-introduced-efficient-agile-retrospectives/actions.jpg" title="Photo of the flipchart with agreed actions" ></p>

<ul>
<li>Do it :</li>
</ul>


<p>As soon as the retrospective is finished, the animator must enter the actions in the coming sprint backlog. These actions are not user stories, but they <strong>must</strong> be done. If there are not, the team cannot be agile as they will be no continuous improvement. Don&rsquo;t assign any story points to these items, but let the velocity auto adjust for a given amount of improvements during every sprint.</p>

<p>After the first one, every team member animated such a retrospective, one after the other. When everyone was at ease with this, we changed the format. We bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649/ref=pd_sim_b_1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0QA643CPNSQE9E0GSG5E">Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great</a> and everyone was responsible for designing his own retrospective session when his turn came. This allows different and various insights.</p>

<p>To conclude, here are a few retrospectives hints and guidelines</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone&rsquo;s voice should be equal, everyone should feel free to talk</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry if good ideas are not selected the first time, they&rsquo;ll come back</li>
<li>At the begining of every retrospective, review what happened about what was decided during the previous one</li>
<li>Use sticky flipcharts and stick them on the wall as you go through the different activities</li>
<li>Prepare flipcharts in advances to make the retrospective run more smoothly</li>
<li>Use colored post its to highlight different aspects (good things, bad things or whatever)</li>
<li>Use markers to write on post its (how can one read it from the back of the room otherwise ?)</li>
</ul>


<p>If you haven&rsquo;t yet, you have no excuses not to start now !</p>

<p>The <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> team <a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/582">is already working</a> on this, and I found a small utility app called <a href="http://traviscron.pythonanywhere.com/">TravisCron</a> where anyone can register his repo for an automatic build.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the feature is not yet ready in Travis, and the TravisCron guys did not yet activate my repo. After having a look at the <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/travis-cron">TravisCron source code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb">Travis API</a>, I found out that it is really simple to do the same thing on my own.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how I created <a href="https://github.com/philou/daily-travis">daily-travis</a>. It&rsquo;s a tiny Rake task, ready to be pushed and automaticaly scheduled on heroku that will restart the latest build when run.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/04/brand-open-api-developers/">Every brands should provide an API for developpers</a> &hellip; unfortunately, it far from the truth right now. A few years ago, when I started my mes-courses.fr side project, I would have loved to find a french online grocery providing an open API. I had to resort to scrapping <em>(that&rsquo;s how I learnt that heavily relying on scrapping for a 15hr/week side project is not a good fit &hellip; but that&rsquo;s another story)</em>.</p>

<p>As I am taking mes-courses.fr down, I have extracted the whole unofficial API I had built around <a href="http://www.auchandirect.fr">http://www.auchandirect.fr</a> (I&rsquo;m talking to you french hackers !) into an open source Ruby Gem. Briefly :</p>

<ul>
<li>It walks the whole store, from categories to items</li>
<li>Given valid credentials, it can fill and save a cart</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-v3/">LGPL</a> : anyone can use it as long as they give back any improvement to the community</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s using <a href="https://github.com/philou/storexplore">Storexplore</a>, another of my mes-courses.fr rip-off open source Ruby Gem</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s tested on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/philou/auchandirect-scrAPI">Travis</a> and I&rsquo;m currently trying to make it daily tested with <a href="http://traviscron.pythonanywhere.com/">Traviscron</a></li>
</ul>


<p>There&rsquo;s mainly one thing it <em>cannot</em> do :</p>

<ul>
<li>It cannot procede to any payment or ordering</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s available on <a href="https://github.com/philou/auchandirect-scrAPI">Github</a></p>

<p>Happy scrapping !</p>
