<blockquote>
  <p>After discussing with a few participants, we would like to spread this workshop. Could you come to run meetups in the area where I live?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I liked how you made us go around the room and meet each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The facilitation was excellent, better than anything I have seen before!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://philippe.bourgau.net/a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/">Previously, I introduced the Slow Code Retreat</a> against their never-ending backlog of tasks.</p>

<p>I recently ran the Slow Code Retreat at <a href="https://cfp.devoxx.fr/2023/talk/CVD-6398/(Slow_(code)_retreat)">Devoxx Paris</a>, <a href="https://ncrafts.io/">Newcrafts</a>, and <a href="https://dddeurope.com/">DDD Europe</a>. Feedback has been great. Some people even wanted to run the workshop in their communities and teams! Unfortunately, the workshop may seem challenging to facilitate at first.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to facilitate the slow code retreat workshop myself. Wouldn’t it be great if I could grow my facilitation skills simultaneously?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="detailed-instructions-for-facilitating-the-slow-code-retreat-workshop">Detailed Instructions for Facilitating the Slow Code Retreat Workshop</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mathieucans">Matthieu Cans</a> was an enthusiastic participant in the workshop at Newcrafts. After the session, he asked me if he could re-run the workshop at <a href="https://www.alpescraft.fr/">Alpes Craft</a> the week after. <strong>With the slides, Matthieu ran the workshop both at Alpes Craft and at his company with his co-workers</strong>. He received similar feedback as I did. Again, some participants said they wanted to spread this wider.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to re-run this workshop in our communities, companies, and other conferences!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I prepared the Slow Code Retreat with the <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structures</a> facilitation system. The workshop’s goal is to help developers achieve a sustainable pace. But as a bonus, it will also teach you how to facilitate using Liberating Structures!</p>

<h3 id="you-are-safe-your-audience-will-love-the-slow-code-retreat">You are safe: your audience will love the slow-code-retreat</h3>

<p>The feedback from workshop participants has been consistently positive. Many expressed how the workshop has had a profound impact on their work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will take his advice and start doing the things he taught us. It will make me a happier and more calm engineer. - Participant at DDD Europe</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Big impact! How to look at development as a training system. - Participant at DDD Europe</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks a lot for this workshop. It had a real impact on my way of working. - Participant at NewCrafts</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>😂 I attended the Slow Code Retreat because I wanted to ‘commit’ to a more sustainable coding lifestyle! - A joke by Chat GPT</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This workshop is particularly well-received by experienced developers.</strong> Juniors may not be ready to embrace that there will always be more work than time 😱 ! Consider your audience to determine if this workshop is the right fit for them.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-do-it-the-slow-code-retreat-is-reusable-by-design">You can do it: the slow-code-retreat is reusable by design.</h3>

<p><strong>The workshop is a string of Liberating Structures:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Get in the mood with <a href="https://liberatingstructures.de/spiral-journal/">Spiral Journal</a> (<a href="https://liberatingstructures-de.translate.goog/spiral-journal/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=english">in english</a>)</li>
  <li>Meet and share with <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking/">Impromptu Networking</a></li>
  <li>5 minutes of storytelling to explain how I came up with this idea of Slow Coding</li>
  <li>Sharing what Slow Coding is with <a href="https://liberatingstructures.de/gallery-walk/">Gallery Walk</a> (<a href="https://liberatingstructures-de.translate.goog/gallery-walk/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=english">in english</a>)</li>
  <li>Experiment with different flavors of Slow Coding using <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/15-improv-prototyping/">Improv Prototyping</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Live coding demonstration</li>
      <li>Setting up groups and development environments</li>
      <li>Approximately 30 minutes of slow coding</li>
      <li>Retrospective using <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/">1-2-4-All</a></li>
      <li>You can start with an optional solo round if time allows</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>5 minutes of storytelling to explain what I have learned with Slow Coding</li>
  <li>Takeaways with <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/7-15-solutions/">15% Solutions</a></li>
</ol>

<p>If you have a co-facilitator, you can even replace the two storytelling steps with a <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/22-celebrity-interview/">Celebrity Interview</a>, which would be a 7th Liberating Structure.</p>

<p>Liberating Structures create high-quality and reusable workshops. For proof, other facilitators ran the Slow Code Retreat with success.</p>

<h3 id="you-will-learn-the-slow-code-retreat-is-a-liberating-structures-training">You will learn: the slow-code-retreat is a Liberating Structures training.</h3>

<p><img src="https://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2023-07-22-liberating-structures-the-slow-code-retreat-s-little-facilitation-secret/traffic-signs-new-skills.jpg" alt="Photo of a traffic sign written &quot;New Skills Training&quot;. Given the detailed facilitation instructions, the slow code retreat can serve as a Liberating Structure Training." /></p>

<p>We typically learn Liberating Structures through practice. <strong>The idiomatic Liberating Structures training is a 2 or 3 days <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/immersion-workshops">Immersion Workshop</a>. The Slow Code Retreat can act as a mini immersion workshop.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 Run the Slow Code Retreat and get a taste of the surprising power of Liberating Structures!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I first heard of Liberating Structures at <a href="https://xpdaysbenelux.org/">XPDays Benelux</a> 4 or 5 years ago. They looked interesting, but I classified them as “yet more facilitation activities.” As a result, they always ended up at the bottom of my learning list. I understood my mistake when we looked at how to train Murexians to workshop facilitation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>🤣 Am I becoming a Liberating Structures fanboy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, why should you learn Liberating Structures instead of other facilitation techniques? <strong>Liberating Structures are <a href="https://medium.com/the-liberators/liberating-structures-should-be-everywhere-people-interact-4c816ae512bb">a disruptive language for collaboration</a></strong>. They radically shift how people work together!</p>

<ul>
  <li>They encourage <strong>contributions from everyone</strong>.</li>
  <li>They <strong>thrive in complex</strong> and diverse environments.</li>
  <li>They have a <strong>viral</strong> aspect, and they propagate and spread by design.</li>
  <li>They can <strong>scale</strong> to accommodate groups of 100 or more.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Slow Code Retreat workshop is mostly a sequence of Liberating Structures. That is why facilitating this workshop will teach you your first Liberating Structures.</p>

<p>As written above, Liberating Structures are viral. So <strong>you are likely to see some of the participants reuse 1-2-4-all in a later meeting!</strong></p>

<h2 id="run-the-slow-code-retreat-and-incorporate-liberating-structures-in-your-workshops">Run the Slow Code Retreat and Incorporate Liberating Structures in Your Workshops</h2>

<p>Like Matthieu Cans, <strong>run the workshop, and spread slow coding while becoming a better facilitator!</strong></p>

<p>Find your audience and send an invitation! Before the session:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the slides’ notes for the invitation and purpose of each structure.</li>
  <li>Read the official descriptions of these Liberating Structures.</li>
  <li>Observe how they are adapted to the Slow Code Retreat.
That should give you the knack of Liberating Structures.</li>
</ol>

Liberating Structures are a real game changer in how we collaborate. Use the Slow Code Retreat as an opportunity to get started with Liberating Structures and get ready for the ride!" /></p>

<p>In your future workshops, add high return-on-investment structures such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1-2-4-All</li>
  <li>Impromptu Networking</li>
  <li>15% Solutions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>These structures are excellent starting points to enhance your facilitation skills</strong>. Once you are at ease with those, pick another in the <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/ls/">Liberating Structures menu</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, if you improve the slow code retreat, please <a href="https://github.com/philou/Kata-Slow-Code">contribute back through Github</a>. This way, we will get the workshop better together.</p>
