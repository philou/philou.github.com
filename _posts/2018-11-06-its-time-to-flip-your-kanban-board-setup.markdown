_Flipping your [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) board columns is a cheap way to reduce multitasking and stress. Eventually, it contributes to a more sustainable pace._

2 weeks ago, I blogged about how seemingly small changes can have big consequences. Here is another experiment that could have great consequences.

## The problem with current Kanban boards

As you might know, I use a [personal Kanban](http://personalkanban.com). Through the years, I have been playing with and tuning it to become as productive as I can. Even this [latest description](/my-ultimate-jira-personal-kanban/) of it is already out of date.

This personal Kanban has been serving me well. It has helped me to stay on top of all the things I have to do. It has also helped me to make my workflow visible, and to remain productive.

What's the problem then?

Even though I have been using this board for years, I always tend to start too many things at the same time. I know the theory behind Kanban. I know that a high [WIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process) (Work In Progress) is synonym with multitasking. I know it's bad for me, that it will make me both miserable and unproductive. Yet, I still push too many things from TODO to DOING. I regularly experience stressful moments where I realize I put too much on my plate ...

## It's Obvious, Stupid!

I grew up in France. Like most Western languages, French reads from left to right. Actually, we organize most documents along this left-to-right, line-by-line flow. What's the first thing I see when I open my [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)? You guess it: TODO items!

> ðŸ’¡ What's the first thing I see when I open my Kanban board: TODO items! ðŸ˜°

It's not an accident I tend to stress on what's left to do and to start too many things. Every time I need to access my board, it reminds me how slow I am, and all I still need to do... As a result, I start more things than I can handle. I start multitasking. I get less done, which makes the situation even worse, etc, etc, etc.

## What did I do?

I heard once that inverting the Kanban board setup was good for morale. (Sorry, I cannot remember who suggested that first.) It's a way to focus first on our accomplishments instead of the never-ending flow of things to do.

I gave it a try. Here is what my Kanban board looks like now.

First thing I now see when I open my board are my accomplishments. But the best part is the second thing I see: my work in progress. As these are things I can work on, I tend to stop there and do what I can to close these. I look at TODO items a lot less than I used to.

## Takeaways

Here are the results after almost 2 months of this Kanban board setup. I reduced my work in progress, multitasking and my stress level. In short, it helped me to stick to a more [sustainable pace](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/overtime.html).

Not bad for a 10 seconds configuration change! If you are using a Kanban board, my advice is to give it a go, there's almost nothing to lose, but a lot to win!

## Culturally oriented

Kanban and Kanban boards came from Japan. Traditionnaly, [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system) reads in columns, from right to left. Exactly like Kanban boards! In next week's post, I'll try to imagine what culturally oriented Kanban board setup would be.
