A software team is now using [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) and [AgileAvatars.com](http://www.agileavatars.com) magnets in their daily work ! A few days ago, I sold my first lot of agile magnets. These customers were ready to experiment and iterate, and after trying some things that did not work so well, we came to a great result :

* As the surface of the magnets is rather small (4 by 4 centimeters), it required enough magnetic force to hold post-its and bristol cards to the board. I now use some 0.75 mm thick magnetic board, the same that is used to stick ads on driving cars
* The magnets will be moved from hand to hand every day, I chose high quality glossy paper to make sure they'll stand the test of time.

I did not yet build any automatic order site or app, but I can now ship magnets for real though ! Don't hesitate to contact me through my email or the contact form on [AgileAvatars.com](http://www.agileavatars.com) if ever you want more !
