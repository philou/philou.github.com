_The most valuable activities in a [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) Design-Level Event Storming are UX and [Aggregates](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html) explorations. Here is a step by step agenda that will lead us there._

This post is the third in [a series about how to build event-based systems with Design-Level Event Storming and DDD]({{site.url}}/categories/#how-to-run-a-design-level-event-storming-series). If you haven't yet, start by [the beginning]({{site.url}}/why-should-we-use-design-level-event-storming-for-ddd/).

### 3. Commands

The first step to making the pattern emerge is to prefix every [domain event](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/DomainEvent.html) with a [command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern). This step is pretty mechanic and straightforward. If you have an event called "Trade booked", prefix it with a command "Book Trade". Sometimes, the command names are a bit different, but you should manage to figure this out.

TODO example command Start Game- Game started

### 4. Actors or policies

Commands can either be sent by a human (an [actor]({{site.url}}/detailed-agenda-of-a-ddd-big-picture-event-storming-part-2/)) or automatically by a policy.

Go through all the commands and prefix them with an actor or a policy. Having done a [Big Picture Event Storming]({{site.url}}/detailed-agenda-of-a-ddd-big-picture-event-storming-part-1/) before might help. Look for actors you might already have identified.

TODO sample actors: moderator - Start Game - Game Started

Actors should have a title, and policies should follow the form "Whenever Event X, then Command Y".

We sometimes automate policies with a Mechanical Turk. In this case, it's simpler to keep modeling this as a policy rather than introducing a 'dumb' actor.

TODO sample policy: Player - move piece - piece moved - whenever a piece is moved - backup game state - game state backed up

### 5. Empty read-models and UX mock-ups

Before actors can send a command, they need data from which to decide. That's where UX and read-model come into play.

This step is, again, a straightforward step:

*   We add empty green and white post-its between domain events and actors.Â 
*   The green post-its are for read-models.Â 
*   The white post-its are for the UX mock-ups.

TODO example read models: ambiguous rule encountered - green - white - player - send feedback on rule - feedback on rule sent

We just set up the stage for the next step.

### 6. Content of read-models and UX mock-ups

We just made explicit the points where actors react to new information.

> ðŸ’¡ Design-Level Event Storming is the perfect workshop to discuss UX of domain events

It's time to discuss what the actor needs to know to decide what to do next.

Write down the data you want to display on the green, read-model post-it. Draw a UX mock-up of the screen that should display this data.

TODO example read models: ambiguous rule encountered - read-model(rule book) - white( document, anchors for rules, inline comment tool, send button) - player - send feedback on rule

### 7. External systems

We've been looking at what happens 'after' a domain event. Let's dive into what happens between a command and an Event.

Let's check the picture that explains everything again. It tells us that [external systems]({{site.url}}/detailed-agenda-of-a-ddd-big-picture-event-storming-part-2/) raise domain events too.

If you did a Big Picture Event Storming before, you'd already have spotted a few external systems. Copy them to pink post-its, and stick them between Commands and Events where it makes sense.

In the scope of a bounded context, other contexts become external systems too! Go through all your commands. Add a pink post-it between the command and the event when they involve another context. Write the name of the other context on the pink post-it.

TODO sample policy: piece moved - whenever a piece is moved - backup game state - Backup Context - game state backed up

### 8. Empty aggregates

Here's another mechanic step. If an external system did not raise an event, then an aggregate must have raised it.

Go through all commands and events that are not linked by an external system. Add an empty yellow post-it there.

TODO sample: moderator - Start Game - Yellow - Game started

### 9. Content of aggregates

Now is the time to fill in the aggregates.

> ðŸ’¡ Discussing what Aggregates will do is the key moment of Design-Level Event Storming

Please don't call them aggregates! [Remember the first rule of DDD? Don't speak about DDD.]({{site.url}}/how-to-use-event-storming-to-introduce-domain-driven-design/) It's going to work better if you call them Business Rules.

Ask participants to fill in these business rules with:

*   Preconditions: what must be true before
*   Postconditions: what is valid after
*   Invariants: important things that remain true all along

If you want to learn more about these concepts, check out [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11331964/what-are-the-differences-pre-condition-post-condition-and-invariant-in-computer). Some business rules are dead-simple, but others generate much discussion. This knowledge sharing between domain experts and developers is invaluable.

TODO sample: Start Game - Yellow(pre: pieces frozen, players > 1; post: pieces unfrozen, current player 1st alphabetical order; invariant: ...) - Game started

### 10. Name aggregates

Up to now, we've always kept the chronology in the design. Let's break this!

This last step helps us to identify aggregates around which we'll code the system. When you spot 2 business rules that deal with similar data, move them on top of one another.

> ðŸ’¡ Finding good names for Aggregates is the last thing we do in a Design-Level Event Storming

Your board should start to look like that:

TODO sample board

At this point, it should be easy to name your aggregates! Add an extra yellow post-it on top of aggregates to give the group a name.

TODO sample: Game Aggregate (Start Game - Aggregate - Game started + Stop Game - Aggregate - Game stoped)

## To be continued

Congratulation, you've reached the end of the workshop!

This post was the third in [a series about how to build event-based systems with Design-Level Event Storming and DDD]({{site.url}}/categories/#how-to-run-a-design-level-event-storming-series). The next, and last, post will provide tactics to reap the most value out of a Design-Level Event Storming.
