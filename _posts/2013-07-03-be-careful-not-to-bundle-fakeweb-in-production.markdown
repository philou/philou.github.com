For testing purpose, I added [FakeWeb](https://github.com/chrisk/fakeweb) to my app. Later, I deployed it to a staging env on heroku to find out that my scrapper started to fail with some strange Net::HTTPForbidden were occuring after about 90 minutes of scrapping, with no clear reason. It turned that I had mistakenly added FakeWeb to all environments, and that just removing it fixed the issue !

As it is working now, I didn't take the time to dig deeper into it ...
