description: "Design-Level Event Storming is a collaborative design workshop. We can use it to build and share the design of critical parts of a system, in only a few hours! It relies on Event Sourcing and Tactical Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It's the perfect first step to building a walking skeleton."

_Design Level Event Storming is a collaborative design workshop. Use it to build and share the design of critical parts of systems using Event Sourcing and [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)._

Imagine you are starting a new product with your team. You had been struggling for a while about how to start.

*   What should the high-level design be?
*   What should we focus on first?
*   What are the main risks?

All these questions remained unanswered until you heard about [Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/)!

You decided to try [Big Picture Event Storming]({{site.url}}/categories/#squash-bduf-with-event-storming-series). In a single (and intense) day, you drafted a functional architecture vision! That's more progress than you had made in weeks. You managed to [identify the primary contexts in your domain]({{site.url}}/build-or-buy-software-identify-your-core-functional-areas-with-event-storming-and-ddd/). You [highlighted the topics you'll focus on to create your competitive advantage]({{site.url}}/build-or-buy-software-identify-your-core-functional-areas-with-event-storming-and-ddd/). These are your core sub-domains.

Everyone in the team now understands where to focus. Developers also know [what sub-parts of the system should remain independent]({{site.url}}/focus-on-core-domain-with-relationships-from-ddd-and-event-storming/). It looks like developers are ready to start coding!

Big-Picture and Design-Level Event Storming workshop are really about making the best start possible when building systems with Domain-Driven Design (DDD)]({{site.url}}/imgs/2019-10-06-why-should-we-use-design-level-event-storming-for-ddd/starting-block.jpg)

*Wait!* Event Storming has more to offer!

Let's dive into a core context with Design-Level Event Storming.Â 

> ðŸ’¡ Big Picture Event Storming was about exploring [strategic DDD](https://thedomaindrivendesign.io/what-is-strategic-design/); Design-Level Event Storming is about [tactical DDD](https://thedomaindrivendesign.io/what-is-tactical-design/) inside a domain.

## The goal

The Design Level flavor of Event Storming lets you dive into the details of a [bounded context](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html). Its primary outcome is a good enough design vision. Developers who attend the workshop should be able to start coding straight away.

> ðŸ’¡ Developers who attend the workshop should be able to start coding right after a Design Level Event Storming.

Design Level Event Storming is particularly suited to design DDD [event-Sourced systems](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html). In any case, it can be useful even if you are not building an event-based system. It helps in identifying aggregates and other crucial domain concepts.

[Similarly to Big Picture Event Storming, the Design Level flavor is a time compressor!]({{site.url}}/how-to-squash-big-design-up-front-in-a-few-days-with-event-storming/) It shrinks weeks of up-front or emerging design into a few hours. It is intense and high bandwidth collaboration that makes this possible. It's the perfect balance between [Big Up-Front Design]({{site.url}}/misadventures-with-big-design-up-front/) and [Emerging Design]({{site.url}}/categories/#incremental-software-development). With a better start, it sets a sustainable pace for the team from the beginning!

Like Big Picture Event Storming, again, it helps us [to spot critical topics]({{site.url}}/detailed-agenda-of-a-ddd-big-picture-event-storming-part-1/). For example, [the most pressing problems and the primary domain concept definitions]({{site.url}}/5-views-to-capture-the-outputs-of-an-event-storming-workshop/).
