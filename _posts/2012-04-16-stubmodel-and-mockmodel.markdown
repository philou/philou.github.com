I decided to stop using stub_model and mock_model. I do not use them enough to get fluent with them. Every time I have to deal with them, something breaks in an unexpected way. I just decided to stand with good old stubs.

I am also thinking of switching to RR (double ruby) and to use proxy objects to get simplify mocking even further. Did you try it ?
