We just discovered a hack to spread agile ([BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) by the way) through an organization. It works provided :

* There is a BDD testing expert in your team
* Your team is using the work of another software team from your company

If this team does not use agile practices, they are likely to regularly create regressions or to be late at providing new versions.

Use your client role in the relation, and propose your help ! Spend some time with them to help them put automated customer tests in place. Be genuinely nice with them, show example, be available and, obviously, bring improvement. With some chance, they might soon be asking for more.

```ruby
Given there are too many bugs
When you can help
Then DO IT !
```
