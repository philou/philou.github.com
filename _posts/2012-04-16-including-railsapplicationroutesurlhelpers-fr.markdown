When I migrated from rails 2.0 to rails 3.0, I had to change inclusion of `ActionController::UrlWriter` to `Rails.application.routes.url_helpers`. I started to get strange errors like ``` undefined 'default_url_options' ``` when running my specs. The issue was that I was including a module himself including `Rails.application.routes.url_helpers`.

```ruby
module PathBarHelper

  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers
  ...

end
```

As if at module definition time, url_helpers was not yet completely ready. I changed the code to include url helpers through a hook :

```ruby
module PathBarHelper

  def self.included(base)
   base.send :include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers
  end
  ...

end
```

That did the trick, but I must admit I did not dig the issue completely. Tell me if you did ?
