Most companies don't have [unlimited vacations](https://management30.com/product/workouts/performance-management/). Most likely, if you are an employee, your days off need to be validated by your boss. If you are like me, this feels like pulling teeth ... Every time I have to ask for a day off, I feel like a kid asking for an extra candy

That's not the only issue with how we traditionally deal with vacations :

* The boss has to make sure that there are always enough people at the office to handle emergencies
* If the boss is himself away, getting a day off at the last moment becomes difficult

## Our Delegation Board

Our team at work is already rather agile : we're using a blend of XP and Scrumban, we follow solid engineering practices and we are always trying to improve to deliver more value to our users. After reading [Management 3.0](http://www.amazon.com/Management-3-0-Developers-Developing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321712471/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;ie=UTF8&qid=1457988177&sr=8-1&keywords=management+3.0) and [Management Workouts](https://management30.com/product/workouts/) I was convinced that I needed to move the team towards even more self organization.

We started by doing [delegation poker](https://management30.com/product/delegation-poker/), we created a [delegation board](https://management30.com/product/workouts/delegation-employee-engagement/), and set out to move all cards we could to the right side of the board.

We spotted the following topics that could be more self organized

* vacations
* hiring
* business objectives and end of year evaluations
* various recurring scrum related activities
* self development objectives

## Vacations

We decided to tackle vacations first, because it seemed easy. We did a quick brainstorming, and here is what we came up with :

* We cannot change the company policy, so I'll still have to officially validate everyone's vacations in the system but ...
* I'll validate anything asked !
* Our internal system allows to check the other team member's vacations, so everyone in the team is responsible to check that there will always be at least 2 people at work before taking a day off

It's been 6 months, and it's been working like a charm. I think it made everything simpler once we had a clear rule about when vacations were OK or not.
