_In [this podcast](https://rahul-bhattacharya.com/2019/05/17/episode-8-is-xp-the-middle-child-of-agile-with-philippe-bourgau/), you'll learn about [eXtreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming). Where did it come from? What are its differences between XP and [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) or [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)? How things like [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) build on it?_

A few months ago, [Rahul](https://rahul-bhattacharya.com/) asked me if I would like to record a podcast for his Agile Atelier. Here it is! Aside differences between XP and Scrum or Kanban, it also addresses concepts like:

*   How to use [Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/) for complex decisions
*   How XP creates a [sustainable pace](http://www.sustainablepace.net/what-is-sustainable-pace)
*   Why merciless [refactoring](/categories/#refactoring) is key to XP

Here it is:
