_"Developers will always have more work than time" We can race our TODO lists or accept and slow down NOW. The "Slow Code Retreat" helps us do that!_

![First slide of the Slow Code Retreat workshop. It shows a snail crossing the street, with the title of the workshop written.]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/developers-life-race.jpg)

> The team is good, but the organization mainly pushes them for output!

> Developers have as much difficulty changing their habits as anyone else. Besides, we're too busy. 

> This manager was in my interview and kept asking me questions like: "what if devs feel they are being slowed down?".

We all know this story. Learning new practices or taking on new habits takes time. And **developers always have something more urgent to do**.

Lately, my colleagues and I _almost_ worked with a team struggling with onboarding. We helped define knowledge-sharing actions, trained seniors to run team mobs or katas, etc. Yet, at the moment of setting up team sessions, **senior developers were too busy!**

## There is no workaround: Sustainable pace starts NOW!

> In its most trivial formulation, it's as simple as this. To go from doing A to get to doing B, we have to unlearn A and learn B. That takes time. If we don't have time, we can't afford to change. ([Slash the Load]([https://www.geepawhill.org/2022/10/25/slash-the-load](https://www.geepawhill.org/2022/10/25/slash-the-load)), Mike Hill).

Teams only have so much control over their time! **There are always urgent and valuable projects to deliver**. Even productivity and sustainability improvements only add more work in the short term! Very often, management will not grant the team some time for learning.

Sometimes, it might look **like there are no ways out**!

At every moment, **we have the choice to step back and take it easy**! Nothing prevents us from **injecting some 'sustainable' seconds into work**. It's not about what happens. **It's about our state of mind** and how we live what is happening.

At first, it can be only a few seconds here and there during the day. With time though, we can train our minds to do this more regularly.

## How to slow down at work as developers?

"Inject sustainable instants throughout our day of work" might sound a bit too vague... So let's see how to do this more practically.

![First slide of the Slow Code Retreat workshop. It shows a snail crossing the street, with the title of the workshop written.]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/slow-code-retreat.jpg)

The Slow Code Retreat is a workshop I ran at [XPDays Benelux](https://xpdaysbenelux.nl/). The idea is to let people experience different 'slow working' techniques.

[![Photo of the feedback I received when I ran the slow code retreat workshop at XPDays Benelux]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/feedback-small.jpg)]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/feedback.jpg)
*Here is the feedback I received at this workshop.*

Here is how **the workshop is structured**:

1.  Welcome
2.  Connect with the topic and other participants with these 4 questions:
	- What did you say no to to attend this session?
	- According to you, what could slow code be?
	- From your experience, list a few situations where slow code could have been helpful.
	- What is the big question you bring to this session?
3.  Present 6 slow code practices (see below)
	1.  One or two rounds of slow code practice on code katas
	- Participants pick 1 or 2 practices they want to experiment with
	- They self-organize in solo, pairs, or mobs
	- For 30 minutes, they go through the simplest katas like [Fizz Buzz](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/) or [Pascal's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle)
4.  Takeaways
5.  Q&A

The complete workshop lasts between one and a half and 2 hours.

## 6 slow working practices

[![Drawing of a mind map with the 6 slow-code practices. The structure is the same as that of the following sections. With 2 extra links from Slow Navigating to Slow Self-Retro and Slow Code Reviews.]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/slow-code-practices-mind-map-small.jpg)]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/slow-code-practices-mind-map.jpg)

Participants can try the 6 slow working practices during the workshop. I've split them into 3 categories: coding, communication, and mobbing.

### Slow Coding

We can use these whenever we are programming solo, in a pair, or in a mob.

#### Slow TODO List

*Take the time to focus only on the present task:*

- Keep a TODO list while you code
- Keep track of everything that remains to be done
- Check or strikethrough steps as you do them
- Indent sub-tasks
- Can use a .txt, a .markdown, a shared online doc, or a mind map
- Reorganize your tasks when needed
- If you revert steps that you cannot do yet, it becomes the Mikado Method

##### Benefits:

- This **removes all the mental load involved with keeping track** of the status of work
- The map serves as a **communication tool** for handovers, pairing, or mobbing
- Helps us to **drop things** that we eventually decide not to do!

#### Slow Baby Steps

![Photo of stairs with "Step by Step" written on the first 3 steps. By itself, pushing TDD to the extreme, like when using TCR for example, is a way to go slow!]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/step-by-step-stairs.jpg)

*Take the time to practice egoless programming and baby-steps programming with [TCR]({{site.url}}/categories/#tcr):*

- Start coding with TCR
- Whenever you get reverted
	- Notice the feelings you experience and accept that error is humane.
	- Practice humility and Egoless Programming
	- Try again with a smaller step
- As the day goes by, notice how your capacity for flawless work decreases!

##### Benefits:

- With time you'll **learn how much you can do without mistakes**
- This **teaches you to do extra small steps** that cannot go wrong!
- This helps to understand when to **call it a day and leave**
- This **avoids writing low-quality code** when you are too tired

- [The 10 commandments of Egoless Programming](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/)


#### Slow Self-Retros

*Take the time to observe what happens inside us:*

- Set a timer to ring every 5 minutes
- Every time it rings, take a short pause and fill out this log individually:

| ROTI | Did | Learnt | Puzzles | Feelings | Need | Decision |
| ---- | --- | ------ | ------- | -------- | ---- | -------- |
| ...     |     |        |         |          |      |          |

- Use cheat sheets for [feelings](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/5fqbpt/emotional_cheat_sheet_updated_from_emotional/) and [needs](https://www.habitsforwellbeing.com/basic-human-needs-are-your-needs-being-met/) references.

##### Benefits:

- Helps us to **spot our non-constructive reactions** to events like:
	- "I don't know how to do that!"
	- "Damn, I was sure this test would pass! I've got no idea why it's failing!"
	- "How stupid I am!"
	- "I don't understand anything about this code!"
- Develops our **knowledge of inner feelings and needs**.
- Provides plenty of **data for continuous improvement** and retrospectives of all kinds.

### Slow Communication

For the sake of organization, I put only Slow Code Reviews in the category of slow communication. Yet, [Slow Navigating]({{site.url}}/a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/#slow-navigating) could also go in this section.

#### Slow Code Reviews

*Take the time to offer non-violent feedback to your colleagues:*

- When writing reviews
- When voicing feedback in the mob
- Follow the [Non-Violent Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) pattern:
	- List the facts
	- Share your feelings
	- Share what needs you have
	- Suggest a new way of doing things that meets everyone's needs

##### Benefits:

- It **prevents conflicts** from building up for the wrong reasons
- It **improves teamwork, psychological safety, but also the efficiency of reviews**
- It leaves the door open for **more creative solutions**
- It builds our feelings and needs fluency and **self-awareness**
- It is a way to start **learning Non-Violent Communication**

### Slow Mobbing

Finally, here are two practices specifically suited to [mobbing]({{site.url}}/categories/#mob-programming) or [pair programming]({{site.url}}/categories/#pair-programming).

#### Slow Driving

![Photo of a road with a road sign written "Slow Down". Slow Driving in the Mob is a very easy and free way to inject some slow in your day.]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/slow-road.jpg)

*Take the time to be aware of your feelings and thoughts when driving:*

- Accept, or even better, relax into being navigated!
- Stay focused on typing and do what you are asked to do
- Focus on the touch of the keyboard and what displays on the screen
- Don't judge what you are asked to do
- Breath while compiling or running tests

##### Benefits:

- This driving 'pause' makes the **mobbing more sustainable**
- It helps to take a step back:
- Let your **creative mind work in the background**
- Come back to **navigation with a new perspective**

##### References:

- [Mindfulness For Programmers. 3 simple exercises to be more present… | by Julia Di Russo | Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/mindfulness-for-programmers-da6f92147b8f)

#### Slow Navigating

*Take the time to practice egoless programming while navigating in the mob:*

- When other mobsters seem to be struggling with something you've figured out:
	- Observe any criticism or judgment that you may feel.
	- Instead, try to be patient and compassionate.
- When you struggle to understand or solve something:
	- Observe any self-criticism or self-judgment that you may notice
	- Instead, try to accept these feelings and let them go.
- When other mobsters come up with different solutions than you:
		- Strive towards egoless programming and humility by welcoming their solution 

Here is a variant:

- Take a step back in the mob:
	- Strive to remain a neutral observer of the mob
	- Keep a log of what is happening and the mood of the mob. (a bit like Slow Self-Retro)

##### Benefits:

- A compassionate behavior builds psychological safety, **improving decision-making and team performance**.
- A "mob log" can be handy for **continuous improvement** and retrospectives.

## Try the workshop!

Here are [the slides for the workshop]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/slow-code-retreat-workshop.pdf) I gave at XPDays Benelux.

[![Picture of a stack of slides for the "Slow Code Retreat". This contains all the material needed to run the workshop.]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/slow-code-retreat-workshop-slides.jpg)]({{site.url}}/imgs/2022-12-27-a-slow-code-retreat-to-be-less-in-a-hurry/slow-code-retreat-workshop.pdf)

My first recommendation is to try the workshop yourself. My first try at "slow self-retro" was mind-blowing. I was dumb-struck to see the **emotional roller coaster a simple kata would get me through!** If you have close peers to try it with, slow mobbing will teach you even more!

Also, next time you face a team with no time for coaching, don't try to force it into their calendar. Has the team got **"down time" in its calendar**: Scrum slack-time, SAFe Innovation & planning? (Or August in France 😉?) Suggest volunteers try this 2 hours workshop during this downtime:

- **"Slow Driving" and "Slow TODO List" make work more sustainable *and* productive from day 1!**
- The other techniques need more time to install (that might be a topic for a follow-up post)
- All practices will get them to **explore an ignored facet of software development**

Whatever you try, I would love to read your feedback!
