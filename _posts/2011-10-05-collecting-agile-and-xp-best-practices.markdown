There is a huge difference between reading about agile software developpment, and being an agile developper or team. There are a lot of practical best practices that one learns only through practice.

As I am currently building up a training about "practices of an agile developper" for [my company](http://www.keyconsulting.fr), I wanted to collect these best practices in an [XP Patterns wiki](https://github.com/philou/XP-Patterns/wiki)
