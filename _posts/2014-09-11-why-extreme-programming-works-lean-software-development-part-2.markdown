---
I've been programming for quite some time now, in different teams, using various methodologies. I also had the luck to do XP for at least 3 different projects. To me the conclusion is obvious, [XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) delivers more. Even better, programmers working with XP seem to be happier. The only thing I've seen that works better than XP, is fine tunning it once the team has mastered the main principles.

[XP was first put in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming#History) at the Chrysler C3 project for SmallTalk performance issues. After being called for performance issues, [Kent Beck](http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/) discovered that these were only the tip of the iceberg, everything was going astray. As the expert in the room, people started to ask him how to organize. I remember reading some time ago that without having thought about it before, he gathered all the most efficient programming techniques he knew together into a new process. XP was born.

So the question is : what did Kent Beck put in XP so that it works so well ? Let's go through the Flow book and its 175 lean product development principles, to see if we get some explanations.

Going through [the 12 core XP practices](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices), the main Scrum ceremonies and a few common additions, I'll try to explain why they work through the Flow book's principles.

## Whole Team

This is the same thing as Pizza Team, Feature team, Cross Functional Team. It just means put everyone involved in the creation of the product in the same room (On site customer, sales, product people, programmers, quality controllers, operation people ...).

## Planning Game

The work is split into user stories. The customer then estimates the business value of each story, before the programmers poker estimate the required work for them. The game is then to maximize the scheduled business value creation for the coming iteration (1 to 3 weeks).

## Conclusion

Whaoo that's a lot ! I did not expect to find so many principles underlying XP (I even removed principles that were not self explanatory). For the XP practitioner that I am, writing this blog post helped me to deepen understanding of it. As XPers know, XP is quite opiniated, it's both a strength and a weakness if you try to apply it outside of its zone of comfort. This explains why some lean subjects are simply not addressed by XP.

To summarize, here is where XP hits the ground :

- In spite of its image of 'a process for nerdy programmers' XP turns out to be a quite evolved lean method !
- XP anihilates batch size and feedback time
- Pair programming is well explained

And here is where to look at when you'll need to upgrade XP

- Better tradeoffs might be found with a real quantitative economical framework
- Synchronization principles might help working with other teams

Kent Beck could not have read the Flow book when he invented XP, but it seems he just had a bit of advance on the rest of us ...
