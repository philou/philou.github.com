While I was trying to enforce no ssl on a page of <a href="http://www.mes-courses.fr">www.mes-courses.fr</a> with Rack::SslEnforcer, I lost a few hours trying to fix a TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS error ... The server was redirecting from http to https in loop !

It turned out it was my browser (chromium) that had cached a previous redirection.

I fixed it by right-clicking the faulty redirection in the chrome network debugger and asking a cache clear.
