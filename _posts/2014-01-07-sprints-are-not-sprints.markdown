I really don't know why [Scrum](http://www.scrum.org) Sprints are called sprints ! From my experience, the number one mistake made by team starting with Scrum is to work as quickly and dirty as possible to complete the sprint, forgetting the [sustainable pace](http://www.sustainablepace.net/).

Finding another word is difficult though, I thought of 'stage' or 'milestone' that both convey the long run idea, but both feel more content than time bounded. A more exotic word could be a 'Scrum push', it conveys slow and intense action action rather than quick results.

Overall, the traditional agile 'iteration' is not bad at all, at least a lot better than Sprint.

**EDIT 01/08/2014:**

The 'Quick and Dirty' Sprint strategy, is like trying to win a marathon with a greedy algorithm:

```ruby
while not finished
  sprint(100m)
end
```

Not likely to work ... Marathoners know that they've got to stick to a constant speed during the whole race in order to finish it. The way to get faster is to :

* increase this cruise speed just a bit
* get at ease with it during a few races
* repeat

Is there something to learn from this to improve software development speed ?
