_By focusing on small increments and collaboration, [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) practices like [CI](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html), [Pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) or [Mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming), [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), [continuous refactoring](https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Merciless-Refactoring.html) and [TCR](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864) make remote work easier._
