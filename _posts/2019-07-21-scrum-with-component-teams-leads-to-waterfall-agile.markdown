_This infographic presents the perils of [Scrum](/categories/#scrum) with [component teams](https://innolution.com/resources/glossary/component-team). It pushes organizations back in [Waterfall Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-gate_process), late deliveries and non-sustainable work._

## Takeaway

A small ratio of component teams is not necessary bad. When features involve many component teams though, we're in painful integration and [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model). If this is your case, you'd rather rethink your teams organization. Here are 2 strategies:

* [Big Picture Event Storming can help you to pick the right team organization](/feature-teams-vs-component-teams-decide-with-event-storming-and-ddd/)
* [Continuous improvement](/categories/#continuous-improvement) and [coaching](/categories/#coaching) can get your teams to reorganize step by step

During this summer, I'll post a few similar [infographics](/categories/#infographic). [Stay tuned!](http://eepurl.com/dxKE95)
