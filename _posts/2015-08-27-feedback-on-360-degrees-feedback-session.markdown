In [Management 3.0](http://www.amazon.com/Management-3-0-Leading-Developers-Developing-ebook/dp/B004ISL6JY/ref=sr_1_1?tag=pbourgau-20&amp;ie=UTF8&qid=1438085414&sr=8-1&keywords=management+3.0), [Jurgen Appelo](http://jurgenappelo.com/) suggests doing full team 360° feedback sessions instead of more traditional manager-collaborator meetings.

He argues in favor of this practice in order to :

* obviously, get some feedback and improve
* also give feedback to the manager so he too can improve
* help the team to further self organize
* practice everyone's people skills
* have more quality objective feedback than subjective manager feedback
* free some manager time

## Our Experience

We just gave it a try. As a fist experiment, we did it at just 3, all willing to try. Here is the ROTI (Return On Time Invested)

Grade(/5) | Comment
-----------------|--------
5 | Useful and healthy. It's a way to stop grumbling. It's also the occasion to say things that we often don't.
5 | I'm leaving the room with real improvement topics. It calms my emotions, it's like "balm for the heart"
5 | I'm getting out with great advises. I think it's great for team spirit. It took 1h for just the 3 of us, I'm wondering how we'll manage this if we are more ?

## If you want to try it

A few last minute advises  :

* Don't force it onto people, start with volunteers
* There must be a safe and positive atmosphere in the team
* This is an improvement exercices, and it should not be used as any kind of evaluation
* Learn how to give feedback
   * [Our company](http://www.murex.com) provides trainings on non violent communication and positive feedback, maybe yours does too !
   * Appelo explains how to give written feedback in his other book [#Workout](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9492032023). Though better suited for email feedback, I found it a great way to prepare for the session.

I'd like to ear about your experiences with such collaborative feedbacks.
