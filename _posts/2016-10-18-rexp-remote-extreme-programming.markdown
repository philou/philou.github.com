My colleague [Ahmad](https://ahmadatwi.me/) from Beirut gave a talk at [Agile Tour Beirut](http://www.agiletourbeirut.org/) on Saturday about how we adopted [XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) to a distributed team [at work](http://www.murex.com). I gave him a hand and played the remote guy during the talk.

With me through Skype, we did a first demo of remote pair programming on [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) using [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [Floobits](https://floobits.com)

We then did a demo of [remote retrospectives](/trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/) using [Trello](https://trello.com/)

## When should I use ReXP

The conclusion is that :

* If people are spread over 2 or a few cities, and that they are enough at every place to build a teams, just build different teams at every location
* If people are spread over a lot of places, maybe involving many time zones, then the open source, pull request based work-flow seems the best
* Otherwise, if there are not enough people to build 2 teams, that they are spread over only a few locations, that the time difference is not too big, then stretching XP to Remote will work best

As it is said that "nothing beats XP for small collocated teams", I guess "nothing beats ReXP for small almost collocated teams".

## Tools to make it better

As Ahmad said in his talk, tools already exist. We could add that more would be welcome :

* Floobits or [Saros](http://www.saros-project.org/) help tremendously for remote pairing, but maybe cloud based IDEs like [Eclipse Che](http://www.eclipse.org/che/) or [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/) will make all these tools useless !
* Trello works well for remote retrospectives, but some great activities like the [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) are still difficult to do with Trello. I'm sure new tools could do better.
* I'm currently building a [remote planning poker app](https://github.com/philou/planning-poker)
* My other colleague [Morgan](https://twitter.com/mc_moe) wants to build a virtual stand up token to make it flow

Finally, here are the slides :
