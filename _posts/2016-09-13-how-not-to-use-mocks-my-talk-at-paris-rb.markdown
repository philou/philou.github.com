As I already [wrote about]({{site.baseurl}}/categories/#mocking), mocks can be trecherous ... I gave a talk about how to avoid them last tuesday at [Paris.rb meetup](http://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/parisrb/). Here are the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OH3eBgjyMcpupUnGWsHXm7kQjkckFpnJStYYYqBL6Yk/edit?usp=sharing).

It talks about testing, mocking, but also [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and [test proxies Ã  la RR](https://wincent.com/blog/proxies-with-rr) (but for rspec).
