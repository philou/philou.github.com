I don't know if you noticed, but [Octopress 2](http://octopress.org/) preview is slow as hell on [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/). I wanted to try using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) instead. So a few weeks ago, I started to upgrade my [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), Virtual Box and Docker stack ...

Hell loose !

I know all open source software needs to be kept up to date at all time, but it's not that easy. Especialy when the versions in the [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) repostiories are really old and you had to install them manually. Anyway, after a bit of tedious work, I finally got to the point where my Octopress blog was running on a brand new stack. And I got this error :

```

After some searching on the internet, I found [this post](http://alexzeitler.com/blog/2012/01/15/rake-generate-for-octopress-fails-with-invalid-byte-sequence-in-us-ascii-argumenterror/) by Alex Zeitler that made me figure out that locales were not set correctly by default on my vm. I just needed to set this once and for all in my Vagrantfile

```
config.vm.provision "shell", privileged: false, inline: <<-SHELL
  if [ -z "$LANG" ]; then
    echo "Setting LANG to us UTF8"
    echo 'export LANG=en_US.UTF-8' >> ~/.bashrc
  fi
  if [ -z "$LC_ALL" ]; then
    echo "Setting LC_ALL to us UTF8"
    echo 'export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8' >> ~/.bashrc
  fi
SHELL
```

After reprovisioning my box, generate and preview were working as expected !

:-( Now I've got a pygement-ruby issue to deal with, I guess I'll be back on the subject soon ...
