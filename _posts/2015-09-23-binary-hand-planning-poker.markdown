At [work](http://www.murex.com), we are using as we all have Android phones, we are using the [Scrum Poker Cards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=artarmin.android.scrum.poker&hl=fr) app to do our [planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker).

This usually works fine, but newcomers usually have one bad remark about it :

> It's not geeky enough

Obviously, it also does not work if one lakes a phone, but who would come in a meeting without it nowadays ?

Enters the binary hand poker !

Now that's geeky ! I still have to find a symbol for the coffee cup and the question mark though ...
