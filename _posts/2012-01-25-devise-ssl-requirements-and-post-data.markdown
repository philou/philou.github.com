I am using rails 2.3.8, devise 1.0.11 and ssl_requirements 0.1.0. I am having strange behaviour when mixing devise with ssl_requirements. When a form posts to an action that is required to be ssl, the post is redirected to ssl as a get, and looses its post data !

To workaround the problem, I had to require ssl for the form itself aswell.

I hope the situation will be better once I migrate to rails 3 and to newer versions of devise and ssl_requirements.
