Philippe Bourgau, Agile and Craft Coach, solving technical challenges with people collaboration.

_I want to innovate a more sustainable software industry!_

_Join me on the path to higher consciousness so we all become change agents!_

## I value:

- Peace rather than emulation
- Freedom rather than safety
- Disruption rather than tradition
- Deliberate Growth rather than comfort
- Learn while doing and making mistakes!

## I blog about:

- How to work, think, and coach the eXtreme Programming way
- How to run practical sessions, like workshops and courses, to trigger productive collaboration and grow people
- How to change organizations for a more sustainable pace, even when we are at the bottom of the hierarchy

## Bio

An early adopter of eXtreme Programming, I have been practicing since 2003 and mentoring teams since 2006. Thanks to XP and refactoring, I have delivered high-quality, fit-to-purpose, and future-proof software with less stress and overtime.

I have worked on many aspects of software: technical, product, people, process, and quality. I contributed to 2 persons as well as multi-team projects. I designed greenfield systems but also refactored legacy code bases.

I believe the two most essential skills for anyone working in the industry are:

- **Working in baby steps.** It's always possible to split the work into smaller pieces! Craftsmanship, Lean Product Development, and Continuous Delivery fall into this category.
- **People collaboration.** G. Weinberg said: "No matter what the problem is, it's always a people problem." Pair and Mob Programming, Liberating Structures, Event Storming, Verbal Aikido, and Non-Violent Communication all fall into this category.

These two skills make work safer, more sustainable, productive, and valuable! Combined, they transform work.

Today, I help teams to reach these benefits by adapting these skills to their unique context.

I'm currently coaching at [Murex](http://www.murex.com) and [here's my resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ifymw8vg7bditrz/CV%20Philippe%202022-Public.pdf?dl=0). My coaching style is about empowering anyone to inject some change into the organization around them.

I can help you with [speaking]({{site.baseurl}}/speaking/), [training, or running strategic workshops]({{site.baseurl}}/services/) in your organization.

Finally, I love doing side projects, from wannabe businesses to open source.
