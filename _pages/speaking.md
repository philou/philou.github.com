I am an experienced speaker and have spoken at many international conferences: [DDD Europe](https://dddeurope.com/), [Newcrafts](https://ncrafts.io/), [Devoxx](https://www.devoxx.fr/en/), [XPDays Benelux](https://xpdaysbenelux.nl/), [CPPP](https://cppp.fr/), [P3X](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/13255-p3x-2021), [Alpes Craft](https://www.alpescraft.fr/), Agile France, Agile Tour and others.

My talks are always very interactive, almost workshops, and often contain live coding. I make a point of honor that the audience gets out with practical learning that they can apply immediately.

If you would like me to talk at your organization, get in touch.
