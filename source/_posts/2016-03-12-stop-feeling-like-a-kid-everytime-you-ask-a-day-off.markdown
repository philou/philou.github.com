Most companies don't have [unlimited vacations](TODO). Most likely, if you are an employee, your days off need to be validated by your boss. If you are like me, this feels like pulling teeth ... everytime I had to ask for a day off, I felt like a kid asking for an extra candy

That's not the only issue with how we traditionaly deal with vacations :

* The boss has to make sure that there are always enough people at the office to handle emergencies
* If the boss is himself away, getting a day off at the last moment becomes difficult

## Our Delegation Board

Our team at work is already rather agile : we're using a blend of XP and Scrumban, we follow solid engineering practices and we are always trying to improve to deliver more value to our users. After reading [Management 3.0](TODO) and [Management Workouts](TODO) I was convinced that I needed to move the team towards even more self organization.

We started by doing [delegation poker](TODO), we created a [delegation board](TODO), and set out to move all cards we could to the right side of the board.

We spotted the following topics that could be more self organized

* vacations
* hiring
* business objectives and end of year evaluations
* various recuring scrum related activities
* self development objectives

## Vacations

We decided to tackle vacations first, because it seemed easy. We did a quick brainstorming, and here is what we came up with :

* We cannot change the company policy, so I'll still have to officially validate everyone's vacations in the system but ...
* I'll validate anything asked !
* Our internal system allows to check the other team member's vacations, so everyone in the team is responsible to check whether there'll always be at least 2 people at work before taking a day off

It's been 6 months, and it's been working like a charm. I think it made everything simpler once we had a clear rule about when vacations were ok or not.
