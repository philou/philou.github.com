I think I found a way to fix the dirty code problem once and for all ...

In [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) Zaphod Beeblebrox has some anti panic glasses. They feature some special danger detection mechanism that turns them opaque black to save their bearer from panicking.

*(It turns out that Zaphod has two heads ...)*

In 2016, it's shocking that some many hours are lost by poor developers reading ugly code.

Let's build anti ugly-code glasses ! We'd just need an IDE or editor plugin, connect it to [Sonar](http://www.sonarqube.org/) in order to get the quality of the current file, and if too bad, shut the glasses black !

Finally the killer feature for augmented reality glasses !
