Some days, coding feels like speleology or mining ... Dealing with weird and undocumented old logic can even some time be [damaging to the mind](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-keep-your-sanity-while-working-on-a-Super-Dirty-Rotten-Spaghetti-codebase) ! I think we should go to work wearing the adequate protection !

OK, maybe we cannot start to go to work wearing a coverall everyday, but let's say very 21st of June is now legacy code day, the day when every developer maintaining legacy code comes to work dressed like that !

Obviously, that's a joke, but it could attract the attention of other non-coding people on the state of *their* codebase and amount of *their* technical debt.
