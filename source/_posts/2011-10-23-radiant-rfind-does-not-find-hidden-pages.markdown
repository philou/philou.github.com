<p>Suppose you have a hidden newsletter folder in the file following file structure inside <a href="http://radiantcms.org/" title="Radiant is a no-fluff, open source content management system designed for small teams.">radiant</a>:<p />
```
home
  /newsletters
  /june-2011
  /july-2011
  /rss
```
<p />and that you want to use the following tag in your rss file<p />
```xml
<r:find url="/newsletters/"> ... </r:find>
```
<p />r:find won't find newsletters because it is hidden, it has to be published to be found.</p>
