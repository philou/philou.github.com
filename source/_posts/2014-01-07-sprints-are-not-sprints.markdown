I really don't know why [Scrum](http://www.scrum.org) Sprints are called sprints ! From my experience, the number one mistake made by team starting with Scrum is to work as quickly and dirty as possible to complete the sprint, forgetting the [sustainable pace](http://www.sustainablepace.net/).

Finding another word is difficult though, I thought of 'stage' or 'milestone' that both convey the long run idea, but both feel more content than time bounded. A more exotic word could be a 'Scrum push', it conveys slow and intense action action rather than quick results.

Overall, the traditional agile 'iteration' is not bad at all, at least a lot better than Sprint.
