Remaining fit as a developer is a career long effort, if you stop programming, you'll loose it ! As time goes, we are regularly ~~offered~~ pushed into management positions, sometimes by cluelessness, other times by cheer necessity ! Be it temporary or long term, here are some techniques to remain a relevant developer.

## How Joe became a manager

Imagine you're Joe, an expert developer in a small software company. Everything is going fine, he's working on interesting subjects with 4 other, rather junior, team mates. Management is OK, at least good enough not to cause too many troubles when suddenly, the team manager leaves for a better position in another company. Unprepared for this, the small organization has difficuties to find a suitable replacement, and, you'll guess it, Joe is asked to take on management responsibilities until someone gets hired. How is Joe going to continue to do a good job at both programming and management ?

Two weeks into the job, Joe takes a step back and summarizes :

* he feels depressed when he does not program for a long time
* he has the feeling he's been jumping from A to B to C to Z to A, etc for two weeks without actually getting a lot done
* he feels everyone is waiting for him to do things before they move
* his mailbox is starting to make him nervous
* it's difficult to program anything if you are interrupted by meetings throughout the day

Joe needs to reduce his management work if he wants to get back to programming. He has read some personnal effectiveness books, so he knows how one can reduce his amount of work :

* say no : he'll have to keep this in mind all the time, especially when accepting meetings or when asked for some new work
* automate : some tasks can be automated, others can be partly automated by a good process. He'll have to regularly stop and think to improve how he works
* delegate : he'd like to push more work to the team, but it will take some time. He'll read things on self-organized team to know how to do

## Joe's measure of programming time

In order to get some continuous time for programming, Joe books 'programming days' in his calendar. This is also a way to say no to other meetings during this period. He starts with all mondays, he expects to be booking others days as he manages to do more programming. His ideal is to be able to book all week for programming (while still having the management job get done !)

This works a well, and it gives Joe a motivation boost since he has the opportunity to program again :-). There are still a few glitches though :
* Joe often doesn't program 'on his own' on mondays because he is spending is time with junior programmers who are really appreciate his help
* Joe once made the mistake of commiting to a critical programming tasks : he does not manage to finish in 1 day and has to hand it over to another developer, losing more time

Joe is realizing that he is more of a programing coach than a direct developer now, and that he should not commit on critical tasks but rather help others to do so. Pair programming is becoming the norm for him.

## Communication time

While doing his full programming days, Joe realized that emails could wait. If people wanted an immediate answer, let them use the phone ! He now reads an answers his emails in the morning when he arrives at work, at noon just after lunch and on evenings, just before leaving. That's well enough for a day !

Joe also has to interrupt his programming day once for an urgent meeting ... he now reserves 1 hour at the end of his programming days to handle such emergencies.

## Self organized teams

Meanwhile, Joe read some books about self organized teams. Self organization is delegation
