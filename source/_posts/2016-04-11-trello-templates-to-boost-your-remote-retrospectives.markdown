I already wrote how we started to use [Trello](http://trello.com) to do our [remote retrospectives](/trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/). A while ago, my team mate [Bilal Tayara](http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/09/20/agile-retrospectives-using-trello/) started to collect our activities into [trello templates](https://trello.com/agileretrospectives).
