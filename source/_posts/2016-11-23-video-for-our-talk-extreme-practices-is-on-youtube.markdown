As I already wrote about [before](/rexp-remote-extreme-programming/), my colleague [Ahmad](https://ahmadatwi.me/) from Beirut gave a talk at [Agile Tour Beirut](http://www.agiletourbeirut.org/) about how we adopted [XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) to a distributed team [at work](http://www.murex.com). I was the remote buddy during the talk.

It was recorded and is now available on YouTube.
