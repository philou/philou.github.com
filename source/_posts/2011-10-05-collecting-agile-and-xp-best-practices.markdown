<p>There is a huge difference between reading about agile software developpment, and being an agile developper or team. There are a lot of practical best practices that one learns only through practice.<br />As I am currently building up a training about "practices of an agile developper" for <a href="http://www.keyconsulting.fr/" title="Key Consulting">my company</a>, I wanted to collect these best practices in <a href="https://github.com/philou/XP-Patterns/wiki" title="a wiki in github">a XP Patterns wiki</a>.</p>
