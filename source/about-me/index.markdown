Philippe Bourgau, eXtreme Programmer and Coach, pushing the limits of XP

*I build high performing and sustainable teams by adapting XP to their unique challenges and context.*

Early adopter of eXtreme Programming, I have been practicing since 2003 and mentoring teams since 2006. Thanks to XP, I have delivered high quality, fit to purpose and future proof software with less stress and overtime.

I have worked on all aspects of software : technical, product, people, process, quality. I contributed to 2 persons as well as multi-teams projects. I designed greenfield systems but also refactored legacy code bases.

Mainstream agile methods like Scrum or Kanban, lacking the technical foundations of XP, fall short of their promises. At the same time, few teams fall in the original pre-requisites of XP.

I have successfully used XP in unforeseen contexts like remote work, R&D projects, and large teams. Today, I help teams to become hyper productive and sustainable by adapting coding, tooling, organization & collaboration habits from XP to their very special context.

Finally, I love doing side projects, from wannabe businesses to open source.

I'm currently technical coach at [Murex](http://www.murex.com).
